    "text": "Hi all, apologies this is a super specific question but just wondering if anyone has this backpack (or any similar packs around 25-30L) and has tried fitting it under the seat on SQ. I’ll be in premium economy on EWR-SIN next month and wanted to bring this bag. It’ll obviously have my laptop and other important documents so it’d be preferable to have it under seat and easily accessible. No biggie if it’s too large and needs to be put in the overhead, but just looking for some first hand accounts of whether under seat is possible.\n\nFor reference, the official dimensions of the bag at 92 cm (43 x 33 x 16) is a bit larger than the 80 cm total dimension (limited at 40 x 30 x 10) listed on the SQ website, but I’ve seen people on here comfortably manage it on Ryanair, which has a personal item limit of 40 x 20 x 25 (total 85 cm), and those were fully packed, which I won’t be, so my best estimate is that it should just about fit fine, but thought I’d ask if anyone has actually tried it. A long shot but better than not trying. Anyway, thank you all for any help, info, or advice!",

      "Another small reason they are reticent to jump ship from Boeing. It’s only because the 737’s design goes back so far (1950s) that it sits so close to the ground making the built in stairs light enough to be economically viable.\n\nOther planes in this size category like the A320 sit much higher, reducing risk of runway debris impacting and allowing them to use larger engines without, well, you know what. But this makes the built in airstairs bigger and heavier.",

I showed where we would like to go and the guy there called for a person on one of the white phones provided. Everyone else could just sit in the next coming taxi but not us. Anyways a couple minutes later a taxi came, we got in. The ride was maybe 5 minutes but the driver said with the luggage - we had two small backpacks for Ryanair - it will be 20 euros.

      "It's probably a bit more than it would have cost using Bolt or Uber (that also depends on the hour and other factors) and depends a lot on the exact location you went to, but quick look on map and both sides of Vitrolles look closer to 7km and 10 minutes. For me it's normal to pay 20+ for ~10km with uber/bolt in the city, so it's not that scandalous. And then, your next best option would probably have been taking a bus to St. Charles and then a bus to Vitrolles, which would have taken about an hour and cost you 15.50 per person, so I don't think your taxi fee here is the heist of this century. You might have been taken advantage of a little, but I would not call it ripped off and you probably did not have a better option anyways....",
      "well, i would say you got lucky that one actually accepted to do such a short ride xD\n\n20€ is expensive but it's not that terrible, by law the minimum a taxi can charge is 8€.   \nIf it was really 2km away, by the \"compteur\" would have really been between 8 and 10€. \n\nSo you probably paid double, but seriously I would have never expected a taxi from Marseille to accept such a short trip; i got turned down once wanting to go to Aix !

    "text": "Please can any pilots help with the queries in this post? First time posting in this sub. \n\nI’m going to Indonesia in 1 month. I feel fine about the long-haul flights to get there and back, but I have to take 2 domestic flights within Indonesia (across different islands) and I’m feeling pretty anxious about it. \n\nFirst domestic flight is 4hrs direct, and the second domestic flight involves 2 separate flights with a layover. Thinking about having to go through another take-off and landing for the separate flights is not a fun thought as I REALLY dislike the sensations that come with take-off and landing. I had a 1hr 30min flight from Kazakhstan (Almaty) to Uzbekistan (Tashkent) last week and the plane felt like it was constantly swaying and dropping from take-off to landing. I was sweating a lot. Logically, I know planes don’t crash due to turbulence but the sensations tell my brain otherwise. \n\nI’m from the UK and have flown a mix of short-haul and long-haul with airlines like British Airways, EasyJet and Ryanair, so I’m familiar with them. \n\nIn Indonesia I’m going to be flying with Batik Air Malaysia and Super Air Jet for the domestic flights. I hadn’t heard of these airlines before so I looked them up for information. I could only see negative things about the airlines but they were mainly referring to delays, cancellations, and expensive baggage allowance. They obviously run many flights per day and don’t appear to have any problems regarding safety. \n\nI believe this is mainly a US-based sub, so I couldn’t find much on here regarding non-Western airline safety regulations, or regarding domestic flights in Indonesia. I saw some comments a while ago from pilots saying they would not fly domestically within Nepal so I’m seeking knowledge and safety reassurance ahead of Indonesia.\n\nCould a pilot here explain whether non-Western airlines adhere to aircraft safety rules and regulations to the same standard as Western airlines? Is there a global aviation safety organisation (or something like this) that every airline across the globe must adhere to? Do pilots across the globe go through the exact same training?\n\nThanks a lot in advance! ",

It's my experience that gate numbers won't be announced until about an hour before the flight departure time - YMMV.",

Normally, that just means flying to another country.  If you are flying to another country in the Schengen area, you don't have to go through passport control or security. You only need to go to the gate. So you'll have plenty of time unless your inbound flight has a long delay or there is a delay retrieving your baggage (if any).\n\nIf you are flying outwith the Schengen area, e.g., to America, then you have to pass through security and passport control as well as recheck any luggage. But you should still have enough time, again, unless your inbound flight has a long delay or there is a delay retrieving your baggage (if any).\n\nIf your flight from Santorini is in the morning, then there is less likelihood of a delay.\n\nMy guess is that you will be fine."

We have been collecting Avios for a while (we had some Qatar flights last year, Amex, Avios purchases).\n\nI really want to take my partner to Prague and use the Avios to reduce the price, if I search EasyJet or Ryanair flights in November, flights now go for about 250£ for both of us without anything extra, I have about 38k of Avios and could get us indirect flights using them for 178£ with all hand bags and even check in bags included.

      "Generally, long haul business class/club world seats are the best use of Avios.  Granted that for two of you, long haul you’ll need to accumulate a lot more Avios, but this can be done using combinations of Barclaycard Avios card, and also BA AMEX (and AMEX Gold) cards. If you are both onboard with applying for cards to maximise welcome bonuses, and also referring each other to gain maximum points, plus achieving the BA AMEX companion voucher it might not be as onerous as you think.   You could always ask chat GPT to formulate a strategy to help you reach whatever goal you decide on, but I always find there is great availability to NYC if you book far ahead in advance. \n\nAlso, flights from MAN, connecting via LHR are considered feeder flights and I’m pretty certain that BA won’t charge you any extra cash or Avios for adding these to your long haul booking - short haul flights are treated differently. \n\nPersonally, for the difference in fares from £178 to £250 I would keep the 38k avios. Even if you have to pay additional for baggage. Especially when you consider the extra you would pay for both of you to train down to London, plus the time involved traipsing across town to LHR…\n\nWhen you do finally find yourself sitting in the ClubSuite sipping champagne, you’ll be very, very pleased with yourself! \n\nEnjoy your holidays no matter what you decide!",

    "title": "Sidestep Airfare: Ultimate Tips to Save on Your Next Flight",
    "text": "Soar Without the Sky-High Prices: Your Blueprint to Sidestep Airfare\n\nLet's be honest, the biggest hurdle between you and that dream vacation isn't usually the destination itself – it's the seemingly insurmountable cost of getting there. Airfare can feel like a cruel joke, a necessary evil that sucks the joy right out of vacation planning. We fantasize about exotic lands, pristine beaches, and vibrant cities, only to be brought crashing back down to Earth by those astronomical numbers on flight comparison websites. It feels sometimes like the airlines are actively working against our wanderlust, doesn't it? But what if I told you there are ways, clever little tricks and less-trodden paths, that can help you **sidestep airfare** and keep more of your hard-earned cash for margaritas on the beach or souvenirs that won't collect dust? It's not some magic wand or a secret handshake with airline CEOs, but a collection of smart strategies that, when combined, can dramatically reduce or even eliminate the dreaded flight cost. Prepare to buckle up, folks, because we're about to navigate the friendly skies without breaking the bank.\n\nUnlock the Secrets to Cheaper Journeys: Decoding the Airfare Enigma\n\nEver wondered how airfare is priced? It seems to fluctuate wildly, one minute a steal, the next a king's ransom. Understanding a little of the madness behind the pricing can give you a serious edge in finding those coveted cheap seats. Airlines use complex algorithms based on demand, time of year, fuel costs, competition, and seemingly a healthy dose of guesswork. It's like a high-stakes game of supply and demand, and we, the hopeful travelers, are the ones trying to game the system. But game it we can! It's about being savvy, flexible, and knowing where to look. Think of it like being a master negotiator in a bustling marketplace, only the goods are airplane seats, and your bargaining chip is your knowledge of how the market works.\n\nUnderstanding the Airfare Landscape\n\nKnowing the basics is key. Airlines use dynamic pricing, meaning prices change constantly based on a myriad of factors. Think of it like a stock market – prices go up and down, sometimes rapidly. A seat bought today could be significantly cheaper or more expensive tomorrow. This volatility can be frustrating, but it also presents opportunities for those in the know. It’s about timing and flexibility, two superpowers in the quest for affordable flights.\n\nBecome a Flight Deal Hunter: Mastering the Art of the Search\n\nForget simply typing in your destination and dates and hoping for the best. That's like walking into a grocery store blindfolded and expecting to find the cheapest items. Becoming a true flight deal hunter requires a little more finesse, a touch of detective work, and a willingness to explore different avenues. It's not just about finding a flight, it's about finding *the best* flight at *the best* price for *you*. This is where the real fun – and the real savings – begin!\n\nStrategic Searching Techniques\n\n- **Be flexible with your dates:** This is arguably the biggest single factor in finding cheaper flights. Flying mid-week, especially on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, is often significantly cheaper than flying on Fridays or Sundays. Even shifting your travel by a day or two can yield substantial savings. Think of it as the golden rule of cheap flights – flexibility is king (or queen!).\n- **Be flexible with your airports:** Sometimes flying into or out of a smaller, less-trafficked airport near your desired destination can be cheaper than flying into the main international hub. Factor in the cost and time of ground transportation, but often the savings on airfare more than make up for it. It's like finding a hidden gem – a smaller, less glamorous option that's a whole lot more affordable.\n- **Utilize flight comparison websites and mistake fare alerts:** Websites like Google Flights, Skyscanner, and Kayak are your friends. They aggregate prices from various airlines, making it easy to compare. Sign up for email alerts for specific routes to be notified when prices drop. And keep an eye out for \"mistake fares\" – incredibly low prices that are errors made by the airline's pricing system. These are rare, but they do happen, and catching one is like winning the lottery (for travel lovers, anyway!).\n- **Consider budget airlines (with caution):** Airlines like Ryanair, Spirit, and Allegiant offer incredibly low base fares. However, be aware of their extensive fees for checked baggage, carry-on bags, seat selection, and even printing your boarding pass. Factor in these potential costs before booking. It's not always a straightforward bargain, you've gotta read the fine print!\n- **Browse in incognito mode:** Some argue that browsing for flights in incognito or private browsing mode can prevent airlines and travel websites from tracking your searches and potentially increasing prices based on your interest. While the impact of this is debated, it certainly doesn't hurt to try. It's like wearing a disguise in the digital marketplace.\n\nHarnessing the Power of Points and Miles: Your Ticket to (Almost) Free Flights\n\nFor frequent flyers (or even occasional ones!), accumulating airline miles and credit card points can be a game-changer in the quest to **sidestep airfare**. This is where those loyalty programs and credit card benefits really shine. Think of these points and miles as a banked currency specifically for travel. Used strategically, they can take you to incredible places without you shelling out a dime for the flight itself. It's like having a magic piggy bank that grows with every purchase or flight.\n\nThe Points and Miles Playbook\n\n1. **Sign up for airline loyalty programs:** Even if you don't fly frequently, sign up for programs for airlines you might fly in the future. Accumulate miles even on infrequent trips. Every little bit helps!\n2. **Get a travel rewards credit card:** Look for credit cards that offer generous sign-up bonuses and ongoing rewards in the form of points or miles. Pay attention to categories where you spend the most (groceries, dining, gas) and find a card that offers accelerated earning in those areas. Just be sure to pay off your balance in full each month to avoid interest charges that can negate the value of your rewards. Don't let those interest fees eat away at your travel dreams!\n3. **Understand airline alliances:** Airlines belong to alliances (like Star Alliance, Oneworld, and SkyTeam). Earning miles with one airline in an alliance often allows you to redeem those miles for flights on other member airlines. This significantly expands your travel options. It's like having a passport to a whole network of airlines.\n4. **Look for point transfer options:** Some credit card points can be transferred to various airline loyalty programs. This gives you even more flexibility and the ability to find the best redemption value.\n5. **Strategically use your points:** Don't just redeem points for the first flight you see. Compare redemption rates and look for opportunities to maximize the value of your points. Sometimes the best deals are for international flights or in specific cabin classes.\n\nBeyond the Plane: Alternative Transportation to Sidestep Airfare\n\nWho says you have to fly to get there? Depending on your destination and your sense of adventure, exploring alternative modes of transportation can not only save you money but also offer a unique and enriching travel experience. It's about embracing the journey, not just the destination. Think outside the airplane window, people!\n\nExploring Different Ways to Get There\n\n- **Trains:** Train travel can be a fantastic way to see the countryside, avoid airport hassles, and sometimes even save money on shorter to medium distances. In Europe, for example, the train network is extensive and efficient. Plus, it's often more comfortable than being crammed in a plane seat. You can stretch your legs, watch the world go by, and even grab a bite to eat in the dining car.\n- **Buses:** For budget travelers, buses are often the cheapest way to get from point A to point B. While they can be time-consuming for long distances, they offer incredible value. Look for companies like Greyhound, Megabus, or FlixBus depending on your location. It's not always the most glamorous way to travel, I'll grant you that, but it's definitely easy on the wallet.\n- **Driving/Road Trips:** For domestic travel, driving can sometimes be more cost-effective, especially if you're traveling with family or friends and can split the cost of gas and lodging. Plus, road trips offer the freedom to stop whenever and wherever you want, discovering hidden gems along the way. It's the quintessential American adventure, right? Windows down, music up!\n- **Ferries and Boats:** If your destination involves crossing water, consider ferries or boats. This can be a scenic and relaxing way to travel, and sometimes more affordable than flying, especially for shorter distances or island destinations. Think Greek islands, or crossing the English Channel.\n\nCreative Travel Hacks: Thinking Outside the Conventional Box\n\nSometimes the best way to **sidestep airfare** is to get a little creative and look at the journey from a different perspective. These are the less obvious strategies, the travel hacks that savvy travelers swear by. They require a willingness to be spontaneous, resourceful, and maybe a little adventurous.\n\nThink Differently About Your Trip\n\n- **Volunteer:** Many volunteer programs abroad include your meals and accommodation, and some even cover a portion of your travel costs. It's a deeply rewarding way to travel and give back at the same time. You're not just visiting a place, you're actively engaging with it.\n- **Work abroad:** Programs like working holiday visas or teaching English abroad can allow you to live and work in another country, effectively covering your living expenses and sometimes even travel costs. It's a long-term approach to travel, but incredibly immersive.\n- **Housesitting:** Offer to look after someone's home and pets while they're away in exchange for free accommodation. Websites like TrustedHousesitters connect homeowners with house sitters worldwide. This can significantly reduce the cost of your trip, freeing up funds for your flight. It's like a free stay in exchange for a little responsibility.\n- **Embrace the shoulder season or off-season:** Traveling during peak season is almost always more expensive for flights (and everything else!). Consider traveling during the shoulder season (the periods just before and after the peak season) or even the off-season. While the weather might be less predictable, you'll encounter fewer crowds and lower prices. It’s the savvy traveler's secret weapon – enjoying a destination without the frenzy and expense of peak tourist time.\n\n\"Save up to 90% on flights with these amazing deals: https://educdunet.com/\"\n\nThe Mental Game of Sidestepping Airfare: Shifting Your Mindset\n\nFinding cheap flights isn't just about applying strategies; it's also about adopting the right mindset. It requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to adapt. Don't get discouraged if you don't find a rock-bottom price immediately. Keep searching, stay flexible, and be ready to pounce when you see a good deal. It's about playing the long game and enjoying the process of finding that perfect travel opportunity.\n\nDeveloping a Savvy Traveler's Mindset\n\n- **Be patient:** Finding the best deals takes time and effort. Don't expect to find the perfect flight on your first search.\n- **Be persistent:** Keep checking prices, set up alerts, and don't give up. Deals pop up unexpectedly.\n- **Be willing to compromise:** You might not always get to fly on your absolute preferred dates or times, or with your favorite airline. Be open to slight adjustments for significant savings.\n- **Celebrate the wins:** When you snag a fantastic flight deal, give yourself a pat on the back! It's a skill to be proud of.\n- **Don't dwell on the ones you missed:** Flight prices fluctuate. Don't beat yourself up if a price goes up after you saw it lower. There will always be other deals.\n\nBeyond the Flight: Reducing Overall Travel Costs\n\nRemember, a cheap flight is only one piece of the puzzle. To truly make your trip affordable, you need to consider all aspects of your travel budget. Reducing costs on accommodation, food, and activities can make a huge difference in your overall spending and allow you to dedicate more of your budget to that (hopefully cheap!) flight.\n\nStrategies for a More Affordable Trip\n\n- **Find affordable accommodation:** Look at hostels, guesthouses, vacation rentals (like Airbnb), or even consider house swapping.\n- **Eat like a local:** Avoid tourist trap restaurants. Explore local markets and eateries for delicious and affordable food.\n- **Utilize free activities:** Many cities offer free walking tours, parks, museums with free entry days, and beautiful public spaces to explore.\n- **Use public transportation:** It's often the cheapest and most efficient way to get around in cities.\n- **Travel light:** Avoid checked baggage fees by packing light.\n- **Look for package deals:** Sometimes bundling flight and accommodation can offer savings.\n\nPulling it All Together: Crafting Your Affordable Travel Plan\n\n\"Save up to 90% on flights with these amazing deals: https://educdunet.com/\"\n\nSo there you have it. A comprehensive guide to help you **sidestep airfare** and make your travel dreams a reality.

It's about understanding the system, utilizing available tools, and being willing to think creatively. By implementing the strategies outlined here – from strategic searching and leveraging points to exploring alternative transport and embracing a savvy traveler's mindset – you can transform the daunting task of booking flights into an exciting treasure hunt. No longer do you have to feel beholden to the airlines and their often exorbitant prices. You have the power to find more affordable options, unlock incredible travel opportunities, and experience the world without breaking the bank.

      "I get why you’re frustrated, but (speaking as someone who’s fought the same system) the snag here really does come down to how the policy works and the way you submitted the paperwork.\n\nWhat actually went wrong\n\n1. Eligibility rule you tripped:\nXCover/Revolut only covers costs that were paid with the Revolut card that carries the insurance plan. They even spell it out: to claim you must “use your Revolut … Plan to pay for the main transport and accommodation” and be able to show the receipts or statements﻿.\n\n\n2. First claim = ineligible items → hard decline.\nBecause you mixed Revolut-paid and non-Revolut-paid expenses, the adjuster quite correctly rejected the whole thing.\n\n\n\n\nHow to salvage this\n\nYou can get a clean review, but you have to wipe the slate first:\n\nStep\tWhat to do\tWhy it matters\n\n1. Ask XCover to withdraw the faulty claim (don’t just “re-open” it).\tLog into your XCover account → Your Claims → open the original claim → Request withdrawal / administrative closure in the chat box. If chat is unresponsive, email claims@xcover.com quoting the claim reference and write “Please permanently close this claim as filed in error so I can resubmit a corrected one.”\tIf the first claim stays live (even as declined) their duplicate detector will keep killing anything new. XCover’s own help pages say they can reinstate a withdrawn claim later if needed﻿, so they’re able to change its status ask them to do exactly that, but not to reopen it.\n\n2. Wait for written confirmation that the first claim is “withdrawn/void”.\tScreenshot the confirmation or keep the email.\tYou’ll need this if you have to escalate.\n\n3. File a brand-new claim from scratch.\tUse the Make a Claim button, not “re-open”; attach only expenses paid with your Revolut card (add the card statement PDFs), plus Ryanair’s cancellation email and any hotel/meal receipts you paid on Revolut.\tFresh claim ≠ duplicate once the old one is withdrawn.\n\n\n\nSide notes & tips\n\nEU261 – Because it was a Ryanair cancellation, you can still claim the €250/€400 statutory compensation direct from the airline (separate from insurance).\n\nProof bundle – Always upload the Revolut card statement page that shows the last four digits of the card and the exact transaction line; it’s the fastest way to pass the eligibility check.\n\nKeep everything in one PDF – Their portal lets you add multiple files, but a single well-labelled PDF (itinerary + cancellation email + statement) cuts the “missing docs” ping-pong to almost zero.\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nYou didn’t lose because of some XCover conspiracy your first claim broke the “paid-with-Revolut” rule, and the system now auto-flags anything tied to that booking as a duplicate. Tell them to withdraw the original claim altogether, then resubmit a fresh one that only contains Revolut-paid costs. That resets the bot and gives a human adjuster something they can actually approve. Good luck!",
      "Wow this is really helpful, thanks!\n\nIn terms of the Ryanair compensation - because the flight was cancelled due to bad weather, they only offer to change/refund the ticket :( ",
      "Wow that's amazing! I just gave up on any claims using Xcover just because it's usually not worth the effort...but this makes sense. The other thing I probably did wrong all the time is not prepare stuff in advance and double check I submit the right stuff for the right type of claims !"

    "title": "Affordable Flights to Europe from NYC: Your Ultimate Travel Guide",
    "text": "Okay, settle in, because we're about to embark on a virtual transatlantic journey. Getting ready to hop across the pond from the bustling metropolis of New York City to the varied wonders of Europe? It's an exciting prospect, isn't it? The sheer thought of wandering ancient cobbled streets, sipping espresso in a charming cafe, or standing in awe before iconic landmarks is enough to make anyone a little giddy. But before you can start picturing yourself doing all that, there’s one crucial hurdle: finding those just-right flights. Navigating the world of airfare can feel like a bit of a wild goose chase sometimes, a labyrinth of ever-changing prices and confounding options. So, let's unravel this mystery together and get you pointed in the right direction for securing those coveted seats across the Atlantic.\n\n### Ready to Roll: Where to Jet Off When Considering Flights to Europe from NYC?\n\nSo, you've decided Europe is calling your name. Fantastic choice! But \"Europe\" is a big place, stretching from the sun-drenched beaches of the Mediterranean to the dramatic fjords of Scandinavia, and everywhere in between. The beauty of flying from a major hub like NYC is the sheer number of possibilities. Your dream European destination is likely just a flight away, whether you're yearning for the romantic canals of Venice, the artistic buzz of Paris, the historical depth of Rome, the vibrant nightlife of Berlin, or the friendly pubs of Dublin. Think about what kind of experience you're after. Are you a history buff itching to explore ancient ruins? A food lover eager to sample regional delicacies? An adventurer seeking outdoor thrills? Pinpointing your ideal European vibe will help narrow down your search for the perfect flight path.\n\n### Picking Your Landing Spot: Popular European Gateways from NYC\n\nWhen you're looking at flights to Europe from NYC, certain cities act as major hubs, sort of like transfer points, offering frequent connections and often more competitive prices. These are the big hitters, the places where many transatlantic routes terminate or begin. Knowing these key airports can be super helpful in your planning, even if your final destination is somewhere a little smaller. Think of them as your launching pads into the European whirlwind.\n\n- **London (LHR, LGW, STN):** A perennial favorite, and for good reason. London is easily accessible from NYC and serves as a massive gateway to the rest of Europe. You've got multiple airports here, each with its own advantages and disadvantages, so it's worth checking which one your flight lands at.\n- **Paris (CDG, ORY):** Another iconic European capital and a significant entry point. Paris is well-connected by high-speed rail to many other European cities, making it a great base for a multi-city trip.\n- **Dublin (DUB):** A fantastic option if you're heading to Ireland or looking for potentially cheaper flights to then connect elsewhere in Europe, especially with budget carriers.\n- **Amsterdam (AMS):** Schiphol Airport is a major European hub, known for its efficiency and excellent connections. Amsterdam itself is a charming city to explore too.\n- **Frankfurt (FRA):** A massive airport and a major hub for Lufthansa. Frankfurt offers a wealth of connections across Germany and beyond.\n- **Rome (FCO):** The Eternal City is always popular, and its airport serves as a key entry point into Italy.\n\nThese are just a handful of the most popular options, of course. Depending on your final destination, you might find direct flights or good connections to other cities like Madrid, Lisbon, Reykjavik, or Zurich.\n\n### Timing is Everything: When's the Prime Time to Snag Those Flights to Europe from NYC?\n\nOkay, let’s be real. Nobody wants to pay an arm and a leg for a flight. The good news is that with a little strategy, you can often find some decent deals on flights to Europe from NYC. When you fly makes a world of difference to the price tag. Thinking about seasonality is key here.\n\n- **Low Season (Shoulder Seasons - Spring and Fall):** This is generally considered the sweet spot. Think March to May and September to November. The weather is often pleasant, crowds are thinner than in the summer, and critically, flight prices tend to be more reasonable. It can be a fantastic time to visit popular cities without feeling overwhelmed. You might even stumble upon some unexpected sunshine or vibrant autumn foliage.\n- **Peak Season (Summer):** July and August are prime time for European travel, and the flight prices reflect that. Everyone wants to be there when the weather's warm and the school holidays are in full swing. If your heart is set on a summer trip, book far in advance and be prepared to pay a premium.\n- **Off-Season (Winter):** December to February (excluding the Christmas/New Year period) is typically the cheapest time to fly. Sure, the weather can be chilly, and daylight hours are shorter, but many European cities have a magical charm in the winter, with festive markets and fewer tourists. Plus, you can often snag some incredible deals on flights and accommodation.\n\nBeyond the general seasons, specific factors can influence prices. Flying mid-week is usually cheaper than flying on a Friday or Saturday. Red-eye flights, while sometimes a pain, can also be less expensive. And keep an eye on major European holidays or events, as they can significantly drive up prices.\n\n### Duration Matters: Delving into Flight Lengths and Layover Strategies\n\nAlright, let's talk turkey about the journey itself. When you're pondering flights to Europe from NYC, the length of the flight is a big consideration, right? Non-stop flights are the holy grail for many – they're typically the shortest in duration and save you the hassle and potential stress of connecting. Direct flights from NYC to major European cities can range anywhere from about 6 to 8 hours, depending on the destination (London is closer than, say, Rome or Athens).\n\nHowever, non-stop flights aren’t always the cheapest or the most convenient for your final destination. Connecting flights, while adding to your travel time, can sometimes offer significant savings. The trick is to manage those layovers. A short layover (say, under 2 hours) can feel rushed and nerve-wracking if your first flight is delayed. A super long layover (think more than 8-10 hours) can be exhausting, but it can also be an opportunity to get a quick taste of your layover city, provided you have the necessary visas and time to clear customs.\n\nHere's a quick rundown of layover considerations:\n\n- **Minimum Connection Time (MCT):** Airlines and airports have minimum recommended times for connecting flights. Booking a connection below the MCT significantly increases your risk of missing your second flight.\n- **Airport Size and Layout:** Connecting in a massive, spread-out airport like London Heathrow or Frankfurt can take longer than in a smaller, more efficient one. Research the airport layout beforehand if you have a tight connection.\n- **Airline Alliances:** If you book a connection with partner airlines within the same alliance (like Star Alliance, Oneworld, or SkyTeam), transferring luggage and handling delays can sometimes be smoother.\n\nUltimately, the ideal flight duration and layover strategy depend on your budget, tolerance for travel time, and personal preferences. Sometimes paying a little extra for a more convenient flight is well worth the peace of mind.\n\n### Getting Savvy: Unearthing the Best Tools and Tactics for Finding Affordable Flights\n\nOkay, this is where the rubber meets the road. How do you actually *find* those good deals on flights to Europe from NYC? It's not just about luck; there's a whole arsenal of tools and tactics you can employ to give yourself an edge. Gone are the days of simply calling a travel agent; the internet has put the power (and the complexity) in your hands.\n\nLet’s talk about the big players in the flight-searching game:\n\n- **Google Flights:** My personal favorite! It's incredibly user-friendly, allows you to track prices for specific routes, and offers flexible date searches so you can see which days are cheapest to fly. You can also explore destinations on a map and see flight prices to various European cities from NYC.\n- **Skyscanner:** Another fantastic option that aggregates results from countless airlines and online travel agencies. Skyscanner is great for its \"Everywhere\" search feature, perfect if you're open to different destinations.\n- **Momondo:** Known for finding unique routing options and occasionally digging up lower prices than other platforms.\n- **Kayak:** A veteran in the flight search game, offering price forecasting and other useful tools.\n- **Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) like Expedia, Priceline, etc.:** While these can sometimes offer competitive prices by bundling flights and hotels, it's often best to book directly with the airline if possible. This makes rebooking, canceling, or dealing with issues much easier. Just saying!\n\nBeyond these search engines, here are some savvy tactics to keep in mind:\n\n- **Be Flexible with Your Dates:** Even shifting your departure or return date by a day or two can make a notable difference in price.\n- **Consider Nearby Airports:** Sometimes flying into a smaller airport near your final destination and then taking a train or bus can be cheaper than flying directly into the main city airport.\n- **Fly Mid-Week:** Tuesdays and Wednesdays are often the cheapest days to fly.\n- **Set Price Alerts:** Use tools like Google Flights to get notifications when the price for your desired route changes.\n- **Look at One-Way Fares:** Sometimes booking two one-way flights with different airlines can be cheaper than a round trip.\n- **Clear Your Cache and Cookies:** While debated, some believe airlines and booking sites may increase prices if they see you repeatedly searching for the same flight. Worth a shot if you ask me!\n- **Consider Budget Airlines:** Once you've crossed the Atlantic, budget airlines like Ryanair, EasyJet, and Vueling can offer incredibly cheap fares for hopping between European cities. Just be aware of their strict baggage rules and other fees.\n- **Check Airline Websites Directly:** After finding a good price on a search engine, always check the airline's website. Sometimes the price is the same, or even slightly lower, and booking direct offers more protection.\n\nFinding cheap flights takes a little patience and perseverance, but with these tools and strategies, you'll be well on your way to snagging a great deal.\n\n### The Baggage Ballet: Understanding Airline Allowances and Fees\n\nThinking about flights to Europe from NYC also means thinking about what you're going to pack and, more importantly, what the airline will let you bring and for how much! Baggage rules can vary widely between airlines, and getting it wrong can lead to unexpected and hefty fees at the airport. Nobody wants that kind of surprise!\n\nHere's the general gist of it:\n\n- **Checked Baggage:** Most major airlines flying transatlantic will include one or two checked bags in their standard economy fares. However, this isn't always the case, especially with basic economy fares or some European carriers. Pay close attention to the weight and size restrictions. Going over can be expensive.\n- **Carry-On Baggage:** You're typically allowed one carry-on bag and one personal item (like a backpack, purse, or laptop bag). Again, size and weight limits apply, and airlines are getting stricter about enforcing these. Make sure your carry-on fits in the overhead bin or under the seat in front of you.\n- **Budget Airlines:** This is where things get tricky. Budget airlines are notorious for charging extra for checked baggage and often have stricter limits on carry-on size and weight. Read their baggage policies *very* carefully before booking.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Weigh your bags at home to avoid surprises at the airport. If you're close to the limit, consider wearing some of your bulkier items (like that thick sweater or hiking boots) or transferring some items to your carry-on.\n\nUnderstanding the baggage rules upfront is super important for budgeting your trip and avoiding last-minute stress at the check-in counter.\n\n### Beyond the Ticket Price: Considering the \"Hidden\" Costs of Transatlantic Flights\n\nWhile the sticker price of your flight is obviously a huge factor, there are other costs associated with flying across the Atlantic that you should factor into your budget. Thinking about these beforehand will give you a more realistic picture of the total cost of your journey.\n\n- **Baggage Fees:** As we just discussed, exceeding baggage allowances can add a significant amount to your bill.\n- **Seat Selection Fees:** Many airlines now charge extra for choosing your seat, especially for aisle or window seats, or those with extra legroom. If you don't pay, you'll be assigned a seat at check-in.\n- **In-Flight Amenities:** While transatlantic flights generally include meals and entertainment, some airlines may charge for things like Wi-Fi or premium snacks and drinks.\n- **Airport Transfers:** Getting to and from the airport adds to your costs. Consider the price of taxis, ride-sharing services, public transport, or airport parking.\n- **Travel Insurance:** While not a mandatory cost of the flight itself, travel insurance is highly recommended, especially for international trips. It can protect you financially in case of flight cancellations, delays, lost luggage, or medical emergencies.\n- **Currency Exchange Fees:** When booking international flights, you might encounter currency exchange fees depending on your credit card or payment method.\n\nBy considering these \"hidden\" costs, you can build a more accurate budget for your trip and avoid any nasty surprises.\n\n\"Save up to 90% on flights with these amazing deals: https://educdunet.com/\"\n\n### Making the Most of Your Flight: Tips for a Smoother Journey\n\nOkay, you've booked your flights to Europe from NYC, you've got your baggage sorted, and you're ready to go! Now, how do you make the actual flight experience as comfortable and enjoyable as possible? Transatlantic flights are long haul, let's not kid ourselves, so a little preparation and some savvy tips can make a world of difference.\n\nHere are a few things to keep in mind:\n\n- **Choose Your Seat Wisely:** If you can afford it, selecting a seat beforehand can be worth the cost, especially if you have a preference for window (for the views and leaning space) or aisle (for easier access to the lavatory and stretching). Emergency exit rows offer extra legroom but often come with restrictions and responsibilities.\n- **Pack Smart for Your Carry-On:** Bring everything you’ll need during the flight in your carry-on. This includes medications, a change of clothes, toiletries, entertainment (books, downloaded movies/shows), a neck pillow, eye mask, and earplugs.\n- **Stay Hydrated:** The cabin air is dry, so drink plenty of water throughout the flight. Avoid excessive alcohol and caffeine, which can contribute to dehydration and jet lag.\n- **Move Around:** Get up and walk around the cabin periodically to prevent stiffness and improve circulation. Simple stretches in your seat can also help.\n- **Combat Jet Lag:** Try to adjust your sleep schedule to your destination’s time zone a few days before you leave. Once you arrive, expose yourself to daylight and try to stay awake until local bedtime.\n- **Dress Comfortably:** Wear loose-fitting, comfortable clothing layers on the plane. The cabin temperature can fluctuate.\n- **Bring Entertainment:** While in-flight entertainment systems are common, having your own books, podcasts, or downloaded media can be a lifesaver, especially if the system isn't working or the selection isn't to your liking.\n- **Noise-Canceling Headphones:** These are a game-changer for blocking out engine noise and crying babies.\n- **Bring Snacks:** While airlines provide meals, it’s always a good idea to have some snacks on hand, especially if you have dietary restrictions or get hungry between meals.\n\nFollowing these tips can help turn a potentially long and uncomfortable flight into a more manageable and even pleasant experience.\n\n### What About Non-Direct Options? Exploring Alternative Routes\n\nWhile flying directly from NYC to a major European hub is often the most straightforward option when considering flights to Europe from NYC, sometimes the cheapest or most convenient route involves a stop or two. Don't dismiss these options out of hand!\n\nHere are some scenarios where considering non-direct flights might be worthwhile:\n\n- **Lower Prices:** Often, flights with layovers are significantly cheaper than non-stop options.\n- **Reaching Smaller Cities:** If your final destination isn't a major hub, you'll likely need a connecting flight anyway. Looking for connections through different European gateways can sometimes provide better routing or pricing.\n- **Airline Preferences:** You might prefer to fly a particular airline that only offers connecting flights on your desired route.\n- **Breaking Up a Long Journey:** Some travelers prefer to break up a very long flight (like flying to Eastern Europe or beyond) with a stopover.\n\nWhen considering connecting flights, pay attention to:\n\n- **Layover Duration:** As mentioned earlier, factor in the minimum connection time and your tolerance for waiting at airports.\n- **Airport Location:** If your layover is in a city you'd like to explore, a longer layover could be a bonus. Just make sure you have enough time to leave the airport, see something, and get back for your connecting flight.\n- **Airline Reputation:** Research the airlines involved, especially if you're connecting with a carrier you haven't flown before.\n\nSometimes, a little extra travel time can unlock more affordable or convenient ways to get to your desired European destination.\n\n### The Nitty-Gritty: Essential Documents and Pre-Flight Prep\n\nOkay, the excitement is building! You know where you're going, you've booked your flights to Europe from NYC, and you're thinking about what to pack. But before you can jet off, there are a few crucial bits of paperwork and preparation you absolutely cannot overlook. Getting this stuff sorted well in advance will save you a heap of stress and potential headaches closer to your departure date.\n\nHere's your essential pre-flight checklist:\n\n1. **Passport Validity:** This is non-negotiable. Your passport must be valid for at least **three months beyond your intended date of departure from the Schengen Area** (most Western European countries are part of this) and issued within the last 10 years. Some countries might have slightly different requirements, so always double-check the specific regulations for your destination. If your passport is expiring soon, apply for a renewal well in advance – passport processing times can be unpredictable.\n2. **Visas:** Do you need a visa for the country or countries you plan to visit? US citizens can typically stay in the Schengen Area for up to 90 days within any 180-day period without a visa for tourism or business purposes. However, this doesn't apply to all European countries (the UK and Ireland, for example, have their own entry requirements), and the rules are set to change with the implementation of the ETIAS system (European Travel Information and Authorisation System) likely in 2025. Keep an eye on official government websites for the latest information.\n3. **Travel Insurance:** We've already touched on this, but it's worth reiterating. Travel insurance is crucial for covering unexpected events that could disrupt your trip or lead to financial losses.\n4. **Flight Confirmation and Details:** Have a digital or printed copy of your flight confirmation, including your booking reference number. Note down your flight number, departure and arrival times, and terminal information.\n5. **Accommodation Details:** Have the addresses and contact information for your accommodation handy.\n6. **Emergency Contacts:** Leave copies of your itinerary and emergency contact information with a trusted friend or family member back home.\n7. **Notify Your Bank:** Inform your bank and credit card companies of your travel dates and destinations to avoid having your cards flagged for suspicious activity and potentially frozen.\n8. **Download Necessary Apps:** Download airline apps, airport maps, public transport apps for your destination, and translation apps.\n9. **Check for Travel Advisories:** Stay informed about any travel advisories or safety concerns for your destination.\n10. **Pack Smart (Again!):** Double-check the baggage rules for your specific airline and make sure your carry-on contains all your essentials.\n\nGetting ahead of these important details will allow you to approach your travel day with much more confidence and less anxiety.\n\n### The Day Of: Navigating the Airport and Your Flight\n\nThe big day has arrived! You're heading to the airport to catch your flights to Europe from NYC. While it might feel a little chaotic, especially at a busy hub like JFK or EWR, being prepared can make the process much smoother.\n\nHere's what to expect and how to make the most of your airport experience:\n\n- **Arrive Early:** For international flights, it's generally recommended to arrive at the airport at least 3 hours before your scheduled departure time. This gives you ample time for check-in, security, and finding your gate, even if there are unexpected delays.\n- **Check-In Online:** Most airlines allow you to check in online 24 hours before your flight. This can save you time at the airport, especially if you only have carry-on baggage.\n- **Security Procedures:** Be prepared for airport security. Have your ID and boarding pass ready. Know the rules for liquids and gels in your carry-on (they must be in containers of 3.4 ounces or less and fit in one quart-sized clear plastic bag). Be prepared to remove electronics like laptops from your bag and take off your shoes and belt if requested.\n- **Find Your Gate:** Once through security, locate your departure gate. Airport screens will display the gate number, and it's a good idea to check these periodically for any changes.\n- **Boarding Process:** Pay attention to the boarding announcements. Airlines typically board by zones or groups. Have your boarding pass and passport ready.\n- **Settle In:** Once on the plane, stow your carry-on in the overhead bin or under the seat in front of you. Make yourself comfortable – grab your blanket and pillow if provided, and get settled in.\n- **Listen to the Safety Briefing:** Even if you're a frequent flyer, it's important to pay attention to the pre-flight safety briefing.\n- **In-Flight Service:** Be polite and respectful to the flight attendants. They're there to ensure your safety and comfort.\n\nThe airport experience can be a bit of a whirlwind, but by being prepared and following these tips, you can navigate it with relative ease and focus on the exciting journey ahead.\n\n\"Save up to 90% on flights with these amazing deals: https://educdunet.com/\"\n\nConclusion: Ready to Soar Across the Atlantic!\n\nPhew!

They told me they need the **TRN (Transaction Reference Number)** from the airline to track or investigate the transaction.\n\nI’ve asked Ryanair multiple times (through their support tickets and support chat) to provide this TRN, but they have never given it to me. Instead, they just **close my support tickets** saying the payment has been made and refuse to help further. At this point it's useless to even try and get an answer from them, it's been almost a year, and they cannot provide any evidence of the successful transaction, only claiming that it has been done.\n\nI live in Italy, and I’m preparing to file a complaint with ENAC and possibly the European Consumer Centre (ECC-Net), but I’d love to hear from others:\n\n* Has anyone had a similar experience with Ryanair?\n* Did you manage to get the TRN or resolve the issue somehow?\n* Any tips for dealing with Ryanair in cases like this?\n\nAny help, advice, or even similar stories are appreciated, I just want to know how to push this forward.\n\nThanks a lot in advance!",

      "I don't know how it works in Italy, but if I were in the UK, I would sue them using the small claims procedure and the \"money claim online\" court service. It's likely that Italy has a similar small claims procedure. There is also the EU European Small Claims procedure, which can be found here: [https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/e-justice/177/EN/small\\_claims\\_forms](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/e-justice/177/EN/small_claims_forms)\n\nI would suggest given the minimal amount of money involved that you would represent yourself, unless you have an (home/travel/workers union) insurance policy or similar that will help you engage a lawyer for free. You can probably find help on reddit for how to write your claim, and ChatGPT and similar tools would probably also be valuable.",
      "The extent of the tricks these absolute c****** get up to is unreal. Follow it up. Don't let them away with it.\n\n\nFile complaints before paying for legal advice.",
      "Get a lawyer.",
      "You probably won't like the answer, but a lawyer is the only reputable option. I assume you don't have to pay for the court proceedings, and a lawyer writing the case is sufficient. Depending on the country you live in, it might not cost that much. But if you really don't want to hire a lawyer, you can at least threaten legal action; sometimes that works, and then make sure you include a date. Otherwise, you can, of course, contact an arbitration board, but I've never contacted an arbitration board and don't know how much help they can offer.",
      "Thank you for the advice, but my concern is that hiring a private lawyer might cost more than the compensation I’m owed (500 eur).\n\nDo you happen to have more specific suggestions on what kind of lawyers handle these types of cases, or how much it typically costs? Any recommendation on affordable legal support for such issues would be greatly appreciated."

    "title": "NYC to Europe: Your Ultimate Guide for Travel, Tips, and Destinations",
    "text": "Oh, the eternal wanderlust! That itch under your skin that whispers of cobblestone streets, ancient castles, and cafés where coffee is a ritual, not just a caffeine fix. And if you're starting from the concrete jungle, from the city that *literally* never sleeps, well, the leap across the pond feels particularly epic, doesn't it? We're talking about the ultimate adventure, the big one: getting from **nyc to europe**. It’s more than just booking a flight; it’s a state of mind, a logistical puzzle laced with excitement, and ultimately, an unforgettable journey. So, buckle up, buttercup, because we're about to dive headfirst into planning your European escapade from the Big Apple. This isn't your grandma's travel guide; we're going to get real, get granular, and get you across the Atlantic without feeling like you've been put through the wringer. Ready? Let's get started!\n\n### The Genesis of a European Dream: Why Leave the Greatest City on Earth?\n\nSeriously, why *would* you abandon the bright lights and siren song of New York City for a while? It’s a fair question, and one posed by perplexed friends and family alike. But for those of us bitten by the travel bug, the allure of Europe is undeniable. It's a continent steeped in history, bursting with diverse cultures, and offering a kaleidoscope of experiences. From the sun-drenched beaches of the Mediterranean to the snow-capped peaks of the Alps, there's something for everyone. Maybe you're craving a romantic getaway to Paris, a historical deep dive into Rome, an artistic pilgrimage to Florence, or perhaps you just want to wander aimlessly through the charming villages of the English countryside. Whatever your motivation, the call of Europe is a powerful one, a siren song that’s hard to resist, especially when you’re staring at the same skyscrapers day in and day out.\n\n#### Unpacking the \"Why\": The Irresistible Pull Across the Pond\n\nSo, let’s get down to the nitty-gritty. Why the big jump from NYC? What's so darn appealing about Europe that it makes you want to brave jet lag and currency exchange rates? For starters, there's the history, palpable in every ancient ruin, every medieval castle, and every grand cathedral. You can literally walk in the footsteps of emperors, artists, and revolutionaries. It’s a living, breathing history lesson, far more engaging than any textbook. Then there's the culture – the art, the music, the food! Oh, the food! From flaky croissants in Paris to authentic pasta in Italy and hearty stews in Germany, your taste buds are in for a wild ride. Beyond the famous sights, there's the chance to slow down, to savor life at a different pace. New York is all hustle and bustle, a relentless march forward. Europe, in many places, encourages you to linger, to people-watch at a cafe for hours, to get lost in winding streets. It's a reset button, a chance to breathe deeply and experience the world through a different lens. And let's be honest, bragging rights play a small part, don't they? \"Oh, I just got back from hiking in the Swiss Alps,\" sounds pretty darn impressive, even if you only made it halfway up.\n\n### Navigating the Airways: Getting from nyc to europe\n\nThis is where the rubber meets the road, folks – the actual act of getting over there. Flying from **nyc to europe** is undoubtedly the most common way to traverse the Atlantic. It's a long flight, no two ways about it. Think 7-8 hours minimum to Western Europe, and even longer to Eastern European destinations. But with advancements in aircraft technology and increasing competition among airlines, the journey has become more comfortable and, dare I say, even enjoyable (if you're lucky enough to score a seat with decent legroom!). There are direct flights galore from the major New York airports (JFK, LaGuardia - though less common for transatlantic, and Newark Liberty) to a plethora of European hubs like London, Paris, Rome, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, and many more. Non-stop is always the dream, minimizing layovers and getting you to your destination faster. However, sometimes connecting flights can offer significant cost savings, forcing you to weigh convenience against budget. It’s a classic travel dilemma, like choosing between a great slice of pizza and a killer bagel – both delicious, but different experiences!\n\n#### The Nitty-Gritty of Booking Your Flight: A Tactical Approach\n\nBooking your flight from NYC to Europe can feel overwhelming, a bit like trying to find a specific grain of sand on a beach. There are so many airlines, so many routes, and prices that seem to fluctuate with the wind. So, how do you tackle this beast?\n\n- **Start Early:** Seriously, this is perhaps the most important piece of advice. Especially if you're planning to travel during peak season (summer, holidays), booking several months in advance can save you a bundle. Airlines release their tickets far in advance, and waiting until the last minute is a sure-fire way to pay top dollar.\n- **Be Flexible with Your Dates:** If your travel dates are rigid, you're limiting your options. Even shifting your departure or return date by a day or two can dramatically impact the price. Tuesdays and Wednesdays often have the lowest fares, while weekends tend to be the most expensive. Think of it as playing the stock market of airfare – timing is everything!\n- **Consider Different Airports:** Don't just focus on the mega-airports. Sometimes flying into a smaller, secondary airport near your desired destination can be cheaper. For example, instead of flying directly into Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG), consider Orly (ORY). Research ground transportation options from these smaller airports; a little extra travel time on the ground might be worth the savings on your flight.\n- **Utilize Flight Comparison Websites:** Google Flights, Skyscanner, Kayak, Momondo – these are your best friends. They aggregate prices from various airlines and travel agencies, making it easy to compare options. Set price alerts so you're notified when fares drop.\n- **Be Mindful of Hidden Fees:** Read the fine print! Baggage fees, seat selection fees, and even credit card processing fees can add up. Factor these into the total cost when comparing flights. Low-cost carriers (like Ryanair or EasyJet, which you might connect to for intra-European travel) are notorious for nickel-and-diming, so be prepared.\n- **Think About Alliances:** If you're loyal to a particular airline or have frequent flyer miles, check if they're part of a global alliance (Star Alliance, SkyTeam, Oneworld). Flying within an alliance can help you earn and redeem miles and sometimes offer perks like lounge access.\n- **Consider Budget Airlines (with caution):** For intra-European travel after you've crossed the Atlantic, budget airlines can be incredibly cheap. However, they often fly to secondary airports (requiring longer transfers) and have strict baggage restrictions. Don't expect a gourmet meal or lots of legroom! It's a no-frills experience, but it can save you a pretty penny.\n\n\"Save up to 90% on flights with these amazing deals: https://educdunet.com/\"\n\n### Beyond the Ticket: The Logistics of Your European Journey\n\nOkay, you've booked your flight. High fives all around! But getting from NYC to Europe is more than just buying a ticket. There are myriad other things to consider to ensure a smooth and stress-free trip. Think of it like packing for a marathon – the flight is just the start of the race; you need to be prepared for everything that comes after. From passports and visas to currency and connectivity, the devil is in the details, as they say. Getting these ducks in a row beforehand will save you a lot of headaches and allow you to fully immerse yourself in your European adventure.\n\n#### The Pre-Departure Checklist: Ticking All the Boxes\n\nBefore you even think about packing that suitcase (more on that later!), you need to get organized. This is where being a planner pays off in spades.\n\n- **Passport Power:** Is your passport valid? Does it have at least six months of validity beyond your planned departure date from Europe? This is crucial! Some countries are very strict about this. Does it have enough blank pages for stamps? If not, you'll need to renew it, and that can take time. Don't wait until the last minute!\n- **Visa Verifications:** Are you an American citizen traveling to Europe? For stays up to 90 days within a 180-day period in the Schengen Area (most European countries), you typically don't need a visa for tourism or business. However, it's ALWAYS a good idea to check the specific entry requirements for *each* country you plan to visit. The rules can and do change. Better safe than sorry!\n- **Travel Insurance: Your Safety Net:** Don't skip this! Travel insurance is like a superhero cape for your trip. It can cover unexpected medical expenses, trip cancellations or delays, lost luggage, and even emergency evacuations. The cost is usually a small percentage of your overall trip, but the peace of mind it provides is invaluable.\n- **Money Matters: Euros and Beyond:** While the Euro is the common currency in many European countries, others use their own (British Pounds in the UK, Swiss Francs in Switzerland, etc.). Research the currency of each country you're visiting. Inform your bank and credit card companies of your travel plans to avoid having your cards blocked. Consider using a travel credit card with no foreign transaction fees. Having some local currency on hand for small purchases or tips is also a good idea.\n- **Staying Connected: SIM Cards and Wi-Fi:** How will you stay in touch? Will you rely on free Wi-Fi (which can be spotty), purchase a local SIM card (usually a good value), or use an international roaming plan (can be expensive)? Decide on your strategy before you go. Having data is incredibly helpful for navigation and communication.\n- **Getting Around Europe: Trains, Planes, and Automobiles:** Once you're on the continent, how will you travel between cities and countries? Europe has an excellent rail network, which is often a scenic and efficient way to travel. Budget airlines are also an option for longer distances. Renting a car can be great for exploring rural areas, but be prepared for narrow roads, different driving rules (driving on the left in the UK!), and potentially expensive parking.\n- **Learning a Few Phrases:** While many Europeans speak English, especially in tourist areas, knowing a few basic phrases in the local language (hello, please, thank you, excuse me, do you speak English?) goes a long way and is always appreciated. It shows respect for the local culture.\n\n### Packing for Your European Adventure: Less is More, Usually\n\nAh, packing. The bane of many a traveler's existence. Packing for a trip from NYC to Europe, especially if you're planning to visit multiple destinations with varying climates and activities, can feel like a complex Tetris game magnified by a thousand. The key, however, especially if you plan on moving around a lot, is to pack light. \"Less is more\" is the mantra here. Every extra ounce you pack is an ounce you'll have to lug onto trains, up stairs, and through cobblestone streets. Trust me, your back will thank you.\n\n#### The Art of the Savvy European Suitcase: What to Bring and What to Leave Behind\n\nPacking efficiently is a skill, my friends. And for a European trip, it’s a skill worth mastering. Here’s a breakdown of how to build your perfect European wardrobe and essentials:\n\n1. **Layering is Your Friend:** European weather can be unpredictable, even in the same season. Pack layers that you can easily add or remove. Think t-shirts, long-sleeve shirts, sweaters, and a versatile jacket.\n2. **Comfortable Footwear is Non-Negotiable:** You *will* be doing a lot of walking. Leave the stilettos (unless you're *strictly* going out for fancy dinners in taxis) and uncomfortable shoes at home. Prioritize comfy sneakers, walking shoes, or sturdy boots. Your feet will thank you after a day exploring ancient ruins or navigating busy city streets.\n3. **Versatile Clothing:** Pack items that you can mix and match to create multiple outfits. Neutral colors work wonders. Scarves are great for adding a pop of color or covering your shoulders in churches.\n4. **Travel Adapters and Converters:** European electrical outlets are different from those in the US. You'll need a travel adapter to plug in your devices. Check if your electronics are dual-voltage (most modern ones are); if not, you'll also need a converter.\n5. **Medications and First-Aid:** Pack any prescription medications you need, along with a small first-aid kit containing essentials like pain relievers, band-aids, antiseptic wipes, and any over-the-counter medications you might need for common travel woes (like upset stomachs).\n6. **Copies of Important Documents:** Make photocopies or take pictures of your passport, visa (if applicable), and travel insurance information. Store them separately from the originals in case of loss or theft.\n7. **A Good Quality Travel Bag/Backpack:** Whether you prefer a suitcase or a backpack, choose one that is lightweight, durable, and easy to maneuver. If you plan on moving frequently, a backpack might be more practical.\n8. **Reusable Water Bottle:** Stay hydrated and save money by refilling your water bottle. Many European cities have public fountains where you can fill up.\n9. **An Open Mind and a Sense of Adventure:** This is arguably the most important thing to pack! Be open to new experiences, different cultures, and unexpected detours. Embrace the serendipity of travel.\n\n### Arriving in Europe: Stepping Onto a New Continent\n\nThe long flight is over. You've navigated customs and immigration. You've officially made it from NYC to Europe! Now what? Stepping off that plane and onto European soil is an exhilarating feeling, a mixture of exhaustion and pure excitement. The air might smell different, the language around you might be unfamiliar, and suddenly, you're truly *there*. But before you rush off to find the nearest gelato stand or pub, there are a few practicalities to consider upon arrival.\n\n#### Your First Steps on European Ground: From Airport to Accommodation\n\nThe first few hours in a new country can be a little disorienting, even for seasoned travelers. Having a plan for getting from the airport to your accommodation will make a world of difference.\n\n- **Public Transportation: Your Best Bet:** European cities generally have excellent public transportation systems. Trains, buses, and metro lines are often the most affordable and efficient way to get from the airport to the city center. Do a little research beforehand on the best route to your accommodation.\n- **Taxis: Convenient, but Pricier:** Taxis are readily available but will be significantly more expensive than public transport. Make sure you use official taxis and agree on a fare or ensure the meter is running.\n- **Ride-Sharing Apps:** Uber and similar ride-sharing services are available in many European cities, offering a convenient alternative to traditional taxis.\n- **Airport Transfers:** Some hotels offer airport transfer services, which can be convenient but are usually more expensive than public transport.\n- **Validate Your Tickets:** If you use public transportation, make sure you validate your ticket! There are often machines for this, and ticket inspectors can be strict, issuing hefty fines if you don't.\n- **Orientation and Getting Your Bearings:** Once you’ve reached your accommodation, take a moment to get your bearings. Locate nearby landmarks, familiarize yourself with the local area, and figure out the nearest public transit stops. A quick walk around the block can help you feel more settled.\n\n### Embracing the European Experience: More Than Just Sightseeing\n\nYou didn't come all the way from NYC to Europe just to snap photos of famous landmarks, did you? (Okay, maybe a little bit!). But the true magic of Europe lies in immersing yourself in the local culture, in savoring the little moments, and in allowing yourself to slow down and simply *be*. It's about sitting in a piazza and watching the world go by, getting lost in a charming neighborhood, and striking up conversations with locals (even if it’s just with smiles and gestures).\n\n#### Savoring the Journey: How to Truly Experience Europe\n\nThis is where the rich tapestry of Europe unfolds. It’s about more than just ticking items off a list; it's about building memories.\n\n- **Wander Aimlessly:** Don't overschedule yourself. Leave room for spontaneity and just wandering around. Some of the best discoveries are made when you get a little bit lost (in a safe way, of course!).\n- **Eat Like a Local:** Venture beyond the tourist traps and seek out local restaurants and cafes. Ask for recommendations from locals. Try the regional specialties. Food is such an integral part of European culture.\n- **Embrace the Cafe Culture:** Find a cozy cafe, order a coffee or a glass of wine, and simply people-watch. It's a quintessential European experience and a great way to soak in the atmosphere.\n- **Visit Local Markets:** Markets are fantastic places to experience the sights, sounds, and smells of a city. You can find local produce, cheeses, baked goods, crafts, and often delicious street food.\n- **Attend Local Events:** Check for local festivals, concerts, or sporting events happening during your visit. Participating in these can offer a unique glimpse into the local culture.\n- **Learn a Few Words of the Local Language:** We mentioned this before, but it bears repeating. Even a few words show respect and can open doors to more meaningful interactions.\n- **Strike Up Conversations:** Don't be afraid to talk to locals. They can offer invaluable insights and recommendations that you won't find in guidebooks.\n- **Slow Down and Observe:** New York is fast-paced; Europe often encourages a slower rhythm. Allow yourself to adjust to that pace. Sit on a park bench, watch the world go by, and simply observe.\n\n\"Save up to 90% on flights with these amazing deals: https://educdunet.com/\"\n\n### Common Potholes and How to Avoid Them: A Heads-Up for the NYC Traveler\n\nAlright, let's be real for a second. Even the most perfectly planned trip can hit a snag. Travel isn't always seamless, and knowing some of the potential pitfalls beforehand can help you navigate them with grace (or at least minimize the stress). Coming from NYC, you're probably pretty street-smart, but Europe has its own unique quirks and challenges. A little foresight goes a long way in preventing those frustrating moments that can sometimes put a damper on your adventure.\n\n#### Anticipating Obstacles: Preparing for the Unexpected\n\nBeing forewarned is being forearmed, as the saying goes. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you explore Europe:\n\n- **Pickpocketing and Petty Theft:** Unfortunately, pickpocketing can be an issue in crowded tourist areas in some European cities. Be aware of your surroundings, keep your valuables secure, and consider wearing a money belt or a cross-body bag that's difficult to access.\n- **Scams:** Be wary of overly friendly strangers offering unsolicited help or trying to involve you in street games. These can often be scams. Trust your gut instinct.\n- **Language Barriers:** While English is widely spoken, especially in tourist areas, don't assume everyone will understand you. Have a translation app handy or a small phrasebook. Patience and clear communication are key.\n- **Different Customs and Etiquette:** Research the local customs and etiquette of the countries you're visiting. Simple things like tipping practices or mealtime customs can vary greatly. Being respectful of local traditions is important.\n- **Navigating Public Transport:** While generally excellent, public transport systems can be confusing at first, especially in large cities. Plan your routes in advance, understand how to buy and validate tickets, and factor in potential delays.\n- **Strikes:** Strikes, particularly involving transportation, can be a reality in some European countries. Keep an eye on local news for any potential disruptions.\n- **Jet Lag:** It's a beast, especially coming from NYC to Europe. Try to adjust to the local time as quickly as possible. Get some sunlight upon arrival and try to stay awake until a reasonable bedtime.\n- **Over-Tourism:** In popular destinations during peak season, expect crowds. Be patient, try to visit popular sights early in the morning or late in the day, and explore lesser-known neighborhoods.\n\n### Bringing it All Together: Your Epic nyc to europe Journey\n\nSo there you have it – a comprehensive guide to getting from **nyc to europe** and making the most of your adventure. It’s a journey that promises history, culture, incredible food, and experiences that will stay with you long after you've returned to the hustle and bustle of the Big Apple. From the initial spark of an idea to the final farewell at the airport, every step of the process is part of the adventure. Remember to plan, be prepared for the unexpected, and most importantly, embrace the magic of exploring a new continent.\n\n### Conclusion: Until Next Time, Europe!\n\nStepping off that plane back in New York City, you'll likely be a little tired, potentially a little jet-lagged, but undoubtedly filled with incredible memories. You’ve successfully navigated the transatlantic leap, immersed yourself in diverse cultures, and broadened your horizons in ways that only travel can. The cobblestone streets, the ancient ruins, the scent of fresh pastries – they'll linger in your mind, a sweet reminder of your European escapade. Planning a trip from NYC to Europe might seem daunting at first, but with careful preparation and an adventurous spirit, it’s an absolutely achievable and richly rewarding experience. So, start dreaming, start planning, and get ready to say \"Bonjour,\" \"Ciao,\" \"Hallo,\" or whatever greeting awaits you on the other side of the Atlantic. Europe is waiting!",

You can pay for another seat and take a car seat for the baby to sit in if you really want to, but the options for approved car seats are very limited (needs to forward face) so you’d likely have to buy a new car seat if you wanted to do that!

Realistically in a straght battle between two candidates, it doesnt matter, if you're both of equal skill and competence. \n\nThe big difference these days is some integrated schools have hiring and interview agreements with many airlines. For example, before BA were hiring openly, they were only taking in L3 cadets they had \"tagged\". Easyjet are similar, only hiring cadets. Ryanair you can work for on their UK AOC out of Stanstead or other UK Base, but personally I didnt go there as I am against paying for my own training and type rating out of pocket for a 6 month trial contract...but that's just me. \n\nModular can be harder because youre entirely self motivated, self planned, self taught in many ways. Integrated you'll have your hand held, youll be very cookie cutter, your experiences will be limited and you'll be bare minimum hours. \n\nPersonally I think modular is better, but i know many people who started training after me, went integrated, and got hired at airlines before me. So who knows. \n\nALSO IF YOU DO go integrated, DO NOT get an MPL. Only get a CPL/MEIR.\n\n\nI've dealt with Skyborne personally, their facility is great, planes are new and good quality, and have good maintenance. There is alot to be said for training in the UK where the airspace is complex. You will get better skills for it.

    "text": "Hi Everyone,\n\n\\*EDIT\\* travelled to Congleton, not my home address, as that's where we were staying that weekend and where we travelled to the airport from, which is also closer to the destination airport (MCR) than my home address in Chester.\n\nLooking for some help or guidance with a Ryanair claim that we feel has been unfairly rejected.\n\n**Background:**  \nIn December last year, due to a storm, our Ryanair flight was diverted from Manchester to Prestwick. Once there, we were essentially stranded—no transport options were provided, and we were left to sort out our own way home.\n\nTrains were either cancelled or completely impractical, with available routes taking between 10 to 14 hours, involving long overnight stopovers. We had work the next morning and no realistic way of getting home by public transport.\n\nWe contacted multiple taxi companies, with two quoting around £500, and Uber being over £600. Left with no real alternative, we took a taxi home for £500. Ryanair refunded us £132.37, claiming the rest was “excessive.”\n\nWe disputed this through AviationADR, but they rejected our claim today.\n\n**Their Reasoning:**  \nThey cited a price of £346 from a website called [airporttaxis-uk.co.uk](http://airporttaxis-uk.co.uk), saying that this was the “cheapest available” fare. However, this is a *pre-booking* website that only sends a *request* to providers — it doesn’t confirm a taxi is immediately available. That wasn’t an option for us at the time, as we needed an on-demand ride, not something that may or may not be accepted by a company during a storm.\n\nAlso, our actual taxi went to Congleton (not Chester), which we provided an invoice for with the correct address on — although this makes little difference to the fare, it does show we submitted supporting evidence. (The picture the ADR showed us on our claim, was not to Congleton, and instead my home address in Chester which was NOT the journey in question we were claiming for)\n\nWe believe it’s unreasonable to expect us to gamble on a cheaper pre-booked fare with no guarantee, especially during severe weather when availability was uncertain. The local companies we contacted confirmed availability and came through.\n\n**Our Position:**  \nEven by their own research, the lowest they could find was £346. Since Ryanair only reimbursed £132.37, we believe we are at least owed the difference.\n\nADR has now closed the case and told us the only next step is court, which feels incredibly unfair, mentioning that we did not show any evidence supporting that we tried to seek something alternate. How are we expected to know to take screenshots, evidence of video of eveything that night? We were only directly told \"Find alternate resonable transportation, and submit your receipts\"\n\n**Our Questions:**\n\n* Has anyone been in a similar situation?\n* Are we being unreasonable in thinking the local taxi was the only viable option?\n* Do we stand a chance if we pursue this through small claims court?\n* Is it worth contacting the ADR to try appeal this for the £346 - £132.37, I cant find a way to appeal without going to court.\n\nWe'd really appreciate any advice or insights, we feel totally let down by the process and don’t know what to do next.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nINFO FROM CLAIM - \"claiming reimbursement of transportation expenses. The Airline have provided evidence to confirm that a payment of £132.37 has been paid to the Passenger in full and final settlement of the claim. We have reviewed taxi expenses online. Source: [https://www.airporttaxis-uk.co.uk](https://www.airporttaxis-uk.co.uk) We find that a taxi from Prestwick Airport to the Passengers home address would cost £346 as evidenced below:\n\n\\*QUOTE FROM AYR TO CHESTER\\*\n\nThe Passenger has not provided any information that they had attempted to source alternative transport in order to mitigate their transportation expense either by bus, coach or train, and it is for this reason we are satisfied that the amount paid by the Airline is sufficient for the Journey taken",

      "You say trains were completely impractical, what basis do you have for that?\n\nWhat about Megabus, National Express coaches etc?\n\nI think realistically, you'd really needed to get some screenshots from National Rail and the coach companies to show that services were not available. Very important you clarify here whether they were unattractive rather than unavailable, as an uncomfortable, long journey would be seen as a reasonable opportunity.\n\nGetting to/from an address that is considerably different than Manchester Airport is also not a great idea - it just makes things more difficult as you are finding out. You don't have the right to be taken home or to another address, only to the airport. Some airlines are more reasonable in this regard, especially if it is cheaper, but the onus will be on you to evidence that is the case.\n\nDid you make any effort to ring around a few taxi companies, compare some app based services etc? That is the sort of thing you would need to do. Again, screenshots and evidence of call logs to various taxi firms etc. \n\nSo no - unless you've got more evidence than you have stated, you have not exhausted all practical and reasonable means before committing to pay for an expensive taxi. If you have, you have not kept any proof of doing so.",

There was an accident at the airport (unexpected, I know) and the airport was closed, but we were already in and went throught the security. My flight was originally delayed from 7PM to 1Am and then at around midnight it was delayed to 2AM. This whole time we were at the airport. Around midnight I got a message from the airline (Ryanair) that the flight would be cancelled/that I would be able to leave only the day later, on Monday, at 9Am. We were given new boarding passes in the app and the flight number was different. My only issue is that the airport reopened at 10minutes before 1AM which would have left the airline enough time to get us onto the 2AM flight. Can I do anything about this now? I know that the incident at the airport was unexpected, but since the airport reopened at 1AM, I don't think that the flight at 9.20AM was the best option. Also, at 4Am we got a message over the phone that the airline couldn't find a hotel for us or sort some kind of transport. I appreciate you help.\n\nThe flight was from Zagreb Croatia to London UK. \n\nThe first flight number was FR2189\n\nAnd the second FR2194",

      "> My only issue is that the airport reopened at 10minutes before 1AM which would have left the airline enough time to get us onto the 2AM flight. \n\nThere was no 2am flight. It sounds like that flight was cancelled and they used the same aircraft with a new flight number to get you to STN the next morning. \n\nIt is completely understandable that after the airport reopened, flights would continue to be disrupted, especially since it was the middle of the night. Being charitable to Ryanair, delaying the departure to 1 am and then to 2 am could have been realistic updates based on actual information and they sincerely believed they would be able to fly at those times. \n\nBeing less charitable, it was also a good way to force you to stay at the airport. If they had told you from the start that you wouldn’t be flying until the next morning, people would have left and gotten hotels that Ryanair would have to pay for. Instead, they kept you waiting until it was too late and you were too exhausted to do anything but sit there until 9 am. \n\n>Can I do anything about this now?\n\nIf you bought food at the airport you can try sending them the receipts for reimbursement. And they might not even give you that.",

      "I recommend contacting Ryanair directly, either on their website or via social media (so you get answers to your questions in writing). Ryanair is a budget airline so generally, yes, they do charge extra for everything. \n\nPer their website \"You can bring 2 items of carry-on baby equipment for free.\n\nThis can include a pushchair/buggy, car seat, booster seat or travel cot. These will need to be tagged at the check-in desk or at the boarding gate\" \n\nAll our fares include one small personal bag which can be brought on board, such as a handbag or laptop bag (40x20x25cm), which must fit under the seat in front of you. As long as your two backpacks fit those dimensions, you should not have any issues. \n\nBringing milk through security will be country dependent (in the US, TSA allows this with no set limits), this is not determined by the airline. \n\nFeed during takeoff and landing to relieve their ear pressure (or if they won't eat/aren't hungry try to have them suck on a pacifier). \n\nYes, baby can sleep on you in the carrier. You may have to take them out of the carrier for takeoff and landing and just hold them for that, though (in the US this is the policy). \n\nWhen I flew with my (at the time) 4 month old, she slept pretty much the whole time, it was also a three hour flight. We had a few small toys and little books in her baby bag that we used when she was awake to entertain her. Specifically, we would bring out one at a time and only put it away/bring out a new one once she got bored. I wouldn't bother bringing a nursing pillow for such a short flight. \n\nSince your flight is at night, dress baby in comfortable pajamas that they can continue to sleep in once you get to your destination. Change their diaper right before boarding so they start the flight fresh and clean. Bring a small bag within the baby bag that has two diapers, some wipes, and an outfit change for the baby. If you need to change them on the plane, you can bring just that small bag into the airplane bathroom. Pack a change of clothes in your carry on bag as well in case of a blowout or spit-up that happens on you.",

The half full water bottle crinkling occupied my baby for aaaaaages.",

I remove the rear derailleur and hanger. I put brake blocks in so the brakes don't accidentally close without the wheel inserted. Don't overpack the case. I put my pedals and shoes in my carry-on.

When I saw this design flaw that makes it really uncomfortable to carry if you are 180cm or above, I decided to return it. Then I found out that they make you return it on your own responsibility (to bear the cost and to find your own shipping company and to fill a return form stating the reason). \n\nBasically they want to make it as hard as possible to return it, because using dhl it would cost over 50 euros to return. I complained and they made a return label for me and insisted on deducting 15 euros even though the reason of return is a design flaw.\n\nOverall negative experience. \n\nMuch better option, tried and tested on easyjet, is the Decathlon Quechua 23L backpack with some forclaz packing cubes to organise everything.

      "No, there’s no guideline set by Ryanair but as long as you use a common sense approach you’ll be fine (i.e. don’t stay in a 5* hotel on the expectation it will be reimbursed… because it won’t, unless that is really the only available option). Of course you’re not expected to stay in dodgy dingy places either. Aim for your average 2*/3*, or a not-ridiculously priced 4*.\n\nAgain, for food, they’re not going to reimburse expensive, fancy, michelin-stared meals. But your average restaurant will be covered.\n\nTransportation to/from the hotel and eating places will also be covered. Again, not luxury private chauffeur transfers, but public transport and ubers etc.\n\nAnything that’s not essential (i.e. you don’t have to do it) won’t be covered. I saw somebody ask once if they could book an extra day at Disneyland for their cancelled flight and get this reimbursed 🙃🥴.\n\nDon’t worry and don’t overthink things, as Ryanair have a legal obligation to provide you with these things.

    "text": "**Summary**\n\nRyanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline, recently announced significant share repurchases, reducing its outstanding share count. Between June 2 and June 6, 2025, the company bought back a combined total of 318,294 ordinary shares. This included 101,294 ordinary shares purchased at volume-weighted average prices ranging from €23.42 to €24.12, along with 217,000 ordinary shares underlying American Depositary Shares (ADSs) acquired at prices between $27.79 and $28.35. All these purchased shares are slated for cancellation, a move that directly reduces the number of shares outstanding. These transactions are part of Ryanair's ongoing share buyback program, which was initially announced on May 20, 2025, signaling the company's commitment to returning capital to shareholders through share eliminations.\n\n**Panabee Article**\n\n[Ryanair Progresses on Buyback, Erasing 318,294 Shares in Early June](https://www.panabee.com/news/ryanair-progresses-on-buyback-erasing-318-294-shares-in-early-june)\n\n$RYAAY",

    "title": "[EU261][Ryanair] Is Ryanair just the worst company out there? Next steps?",
    "text": "Hi All! I have qeustion but the situation is pretty long to write about, sorry.\n\nOn June 5th, 2025, I was scheduled to travel with Ryanair flight FR4021 from Eindhoven to Warsaw Modlin, with an expected arrival around 17:40. After boarding, passengers were informed that the flight would be delayed due to a technical failure at the destination airport. We were told the delay could last up to 2 hours and were required to remain seated on the plane the entire time. After approximately 1.5 hours onboard, we were informed that the flight was cleared for departure. No information about re-routing.\n\nAbout 30 minutes before the planned landing, we were notified that the issue at Modlin had still not been resolved and that the aircraft would be diverted to Katowice. No explanation was given as to why the diversion was not to Warsaw Chopin Airport, which is located in the same city and also serves Ryanair flights.\n\nUpon arrival in Katowice, passengers were told to disembark without any instructions or assistance. After walking through the terminal, we found the Ryanair information desk where we were told that a bus to Warsaw would arrive in about one hour. No specific destination in Warsaw was mentioned, and we were not offered any food or drinks during the delay or after the diversion. I was forced to purchase food and drinks.\n\nRoughly 1.5 hours later, buses arrived. The driver stated that the destination was Warsaw Modlin Airport. Passengers asked whether it would be possible to stop somewhere in the city instead, since no public transport is available from Modlin late at night. The driver said this decision was up to Ryanair, while Ryanair staff later claimed it was up to the driver. Eventually, Ryanair personnel began checking passengers against a list before boarding, but were dismissive and uncooperative, refusing to engage in conversation or offer any flexibility. We were told that we would be dropped off in Modlin and that was final.\n\nThe journey to Modlin Airport took over 3.5 hours, and we arrived there at around 00:30 — nearly 7 hours after the originally scheduled arrival. No food, water, or alternative transport to the city was provided at any stage. I had to order an Uber at my own expense due to the lack of public transit options at that time.\n\nI contacted Ryanair and received an automatic reply stating that I was not eligible for compensation, citing extraordinary circumstances. This response was frustrating, especially given the lack of care shown toward passengers. Through online research, I discovered that the disruption was reportedly due to a failure of meteorological equipment at the airport — an issue that affected both arrivals and departures that day.\n\nAfter Ryanair’s rejection, I attempted to escalate the matter through ADR. The Polish civil aviation authority (ULC) informed me that since the flight departed from the Netherlands, I should submit the complaint to the Dutch authority. However, the Dutch ILT stated that while they collect such reports, they do not handle individual cases and instead recommend pursuing the matter in civil court.\n\nAt this point, I’ve also explored third-party services such as AirHelp, GIVT, and others that process such claims in exchange for a commission. While not ideal, this appears to be one of the only viable paths left. I was never informed of any alternatives to the bus transportation provided, and when I asked directly whether Ryanair would provide any food or drinks, I was explicitly told they would not. I have receipts for meals and an Uber ride and am seeking full reimbursement for those, in addition to compensation under EC Regulation 261/2004 for the extensive delay and mishandling.\n\nFrom what I understand Ryanair failed to:  \n\\- inform us technical issue still not being fixed when starting (airport never said its fixed)  \n\\- provided no drink or food for the whole process which is illegal from what I read about EU261  \n\\- didn't inform taking the bus to Katowice is not requierd and we can take our own transportation, so didn't inform properly about possibilites   \n\n\nI would like to know whether there are any other viable options beyond using a third-party company or filing a lawsuit. If not, I am prepared to proceed with the most effective route available to recover what I am entitled to.",

    "text": "Just Think About It…The World is Calling, But is Your Wallet Listening?\n\nHave you ever scrolled through stunning travel photos on Instagram, feeling that familiar pang of wanderlust, only to immediately slam the mental brakes when you think about the cost of getting there? Yeah, me too. The price of a plane ticket can feel like the ultimate kryptonite to your travel dreams. It’s like the gatekeeper of adventure, standing there with its arms crossed, demanding a king's ransom. But what if I told you it doesn't have to be that way? What if the most affordable places to fly are actually within reach, just waiting for you to discover them?\n\nCracking the Code: Unearthing the Most Affordable Places to Fly\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThinking about travel often feels like trying to solve a complex puzzle, doesn't it? One minute you're all excited about exploring ancient ruins or sipping cocktails on a tropical beach, and the next you're staring at flight prices that would make your eyes water. But here's the thing: not all destinations are created equal when it comes to airfare. Some places, bless their budget-friendly hearts, practically roll out the red carpet for travelers wanting to visit without breaking the bank. Finding these gems is all about being a savvy traveler, knowing where to look, and being a little flexible. It's not just about scoring a cheap fare; it's about finding destinations where your overall trip costs less, starting with that significant chunk of change that is your flight. So, let's get down to brass tacks and figure out where you can realistically jet off to without needing a second mortgage.\n\n### Factors That Make a Destination More Affordable to Fly To\n\nSo, what’s the magic formula for finding those cheap flights? It’s a bit of a mixed bag, honestly. Think of it like baking a cake – you need the right ingredients and the right conditions for it to turn out perfectly. The same goes for finding affordable airfare and, by extension, the most affordable places to fly. Several factors play a starring role. First off, airline competition is a big one. Destinations served by multiple airlines, especially budget carriers, are almost always going to have lower fares. It’s simple supply and demand, folks. More airlines vying for your business means they have to keep prices competitive.\n\nThen there's the popularity of a route. Hugely popular routes, especially during peak season, are going to cost more. Think about flying to Paris in July – everyone wants to go! But fly there in, say, February, and you might be pleasantly surprised. Distance is also a no-brainer; flying across the country is usually cheaper than flying across the ocean, though there are always exceptions to the rule. And finally, the economic situation of a country can influence flight prices. Destinations with a lower cost of living generally see lower overall travel expenses, including potentially cheaper airfare to get there.\n\n### Timing is Everything: When to Book for the Best Deals\n\nAh, the million-dollar question: when should you book your flight? It feels like everyone has a different opinion on this, right? \"Book exactly Tuesdays at 3 PM!\" they'll say. While there's no one-size-fits-all answer, there *are* some general guidelines that can seriously swing the price pendulum in your favor. Generally speaking, booking too early (like, a year out) can sometimes be more expensive than booking closer to the travel date. Airlines haven't finalized all their pricing tiers yet, and they're often testing the waters.\n\nConversely, booking too late, especially for popular routes or during peak season, is usually a recipe for sticker shock. The sweet spot, for most international flights, seems to be somewhere between two to eight months out. For domestic flights, you can often snag a good deal within one to four months. And here's a pro tip that sounds kinda counterintuitive but often works: consider flying on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays. These are typically the least busy travel days, and airlines sometimes lower fares to entice travelers. Avoiding major holidays and school breaks is also a no-brainer if you're chasing those budget-friendly flights.\n\nFinding the most affordable places to fly isn't just about the destination; it's about the journey to finding the ticket itself. It takes a little digging, a little flexibility, and a lot of knowing the tricks of the trade. Stick with me, and we'll unlock some serious travel possibilities.\n\nOkay, let's dive into the heart of the matter. Where *are* these elusive, wallet-friendly destinations? It's like searching for buried treasure, but the treasure chest is filled with affordable experiences and memories waiting to be made. We're talking about places where the cost of getting there and the cost of being there won't leave you eating instant noodles for a month after your trip. These aren't necessarily the most exotic or far-flung locations (though some might surprise you!), but they offer a fantastic return on your investment.\n\nNorth American Gems: Finding Affordable Flights Without Crossing Oceans\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSometimes, the greatest adventures are closer than you think. You don't always need to hop on a transatlantic flight to find incredible experiences and, more importantly for our discussion, the most affordable places to fly. North America itself is teeming with fantastic destinations that are relatively easy and inexpensive to get to, especially if you live within the continent. We're talking vibrant cities, stunning natural landscapes, and unique cultural experiences, all without the added cost and hassle of international travel. Think about it – fewer hours in the air, less jet lag, and often more direct routes. It's a win-win situation for your wallet and your sanity.\n\n### Mexico: Culture, Beaches, and Budget-Friendly Airlines\n\nAh, Mexico. It’s like the friendly neighbor who always has a fiesta going on. And for budget travelers, it's an absolute godsend. Mexico consistently ranks as one of the most affordable places to fly to from North America. Why? Several reasons. First, its close proximity to the United States makes flights shorter and generally cheaper. Second, there's a ton of competition on routes to popular Mexican destinations. Major US and Canadian carriers fly there, of course, but so do Mexican airlines and a whole host of budget carriers, all vying for your business. This competition drives prices down, often significantly.\n\nThink about destinations like Cancun, Puerto Vallarta, or Mexico City. You can often find round-trip flights for a fraction of the cost of flying to Europe or even South America. And once you're there? The cost of living in Mexico is generally lower than in the US or Canada, meaning your money goes further on things like food, accommodation, and activities. You can gorge on delicious tacos for a few bucks, find a nice guesthouse for a reasonable price, and explore ancient ruins or relax on stunning beaches without breaking the bank. It’s a fantastic option for a truly affordable getaway that feels a million miles away from your everyday life.\n\n### Canada (Domestically): Exploring Provinces Without Breaking the Bank\n\nNow, for our friends up north, or even those looking to explore a vast and diverse neighbor, Canada offers some incredibly affordable domestic flight options. While international flights *to* Canada can sometimes be pricey depending on your origin, exploring within Canada itself can be surprisingly kind to your wallet. The key here is knowing where to look and being flexible, similar to finding the most affordable places to fly internationally. WestJet and Air Canada are the major players, but budget airlines like Flair Airlines and Swoop have really shaken things up in recent years, offering significantly cheaper fares on key routes.\n\nThink about flying between major cities like Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, or Calgary. While prices fluctuate, you can often find competitive fares, especially if you book in advance or travel during the shoulder seasons (spring and fall). Exploring different provinces offers a mind-boggling variety of experiences, from the rugged beauty of the Maritimes to the majestic Rocky Mountains and the vibrant culture of Quebec. It's a fantastic way to see more of this incredible country without needing a passport or dealing with currency exchange headaches.\n\nIt really pays to remember that affordability in travel isn't always about the cheapest flight you can find to the most obscure place. Sometimes, it's about finding places where the combination of affordable airfare and a lower cost of living on the ground makes the entire trip budget-friendly. North America, with its diverse offerings and competitive flight market, is a prime example of this.\n\nReady for more budget-friendly destinations? We're just getting started! The world is big and beautiful, and there are plenty of places where your travel dreams won't cost you an arm and a leg. Let's cast our net a little wider and explore some options that might require a slightly longer flight but offer incredible value once you arrive.\n\nEuropean Escapes on a Dime: Flying Across the Pond Without Sinking Your Budget\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEurope. The very word conjures images of historical castles, charming cobblestone streets, and delicious food. For many, it's a dream destination. But often, the sticker price of flying across the Atlantic can feel like a major hurdle. However, fear not, fellow travelers! Europe is not entirely off-limits to the budget-conscious adventurer. There are definitely some seriously affordable places to fly to in Europe, and once you're there, the possibilities for exploring on a budget are endless, thanks to the continent's extensive and reasonably priced train and bus networks. The key is choosing your entry point wisely.\n\n### Portugal: Coastal Beauty and Cultural Richness for Less\n\nAh, Portugal. It's like Spain's slightly more understated, but equally captivating, neighbor. And when it comes to affordable European destinations, Portugal is often a top contender. Flying into Lisbon or Porto can be significantly cheaper than flying into major hubs like London, Paris, or Rome. Several factors contribute to Portugal being one of the most affordable places to fly to in Western Europe. For one, the country’s stunning beaches and vibrant cities have gained popularity, leading to increased airline competition, including budget carriers like Ryanair and EasyJet.\n\nOnce you're in Portugal, you'll find that the cost of living is considerably lower than in many other Western European countries. This means your budget for accommodation, food, and activities stretches much further. Imagine feasting on fresh seafood and delicious pastries for a fraction of the cost you'd pay elsewhere. Exploring charming towns, relaxing on golden beaches, and soaking up the rich history and culture – it's all incredibly accessible without needing a massive travel fund. Portugal offers a truly enriching European experience that won't leave your bank account crying uncle.\n\n### Eastern Europe: Unlocking Affordable Adventures in a Diverse Region\n\nNow, let's talk about Eastern Europe. This region, often overlooked by mainstream tourists chasing the usual suspects, is an absolute goldmine for budget travelers. It's truly where you can find some of the most affordable places to fly to in Europe, particularly when compared to Western counterparts. Think about cities like Budapest, Prague, Krakow, or Bucharest. Flights to these cities are frequently cheaper, and once you're on the ground, your money goes an incredibly long way.\n\nThe cost of living in many Eastern European countries is significantly lower. You can find incredibly affordable accommodation, eat at delicious and inexpensive local restaurants, and enjoy cultural attractions without shelling out a fortune. The history is deep, the architecture is stunning, and the culture is vibrant and welcoming. It's a region that offers incredible value for money and a chance to explore some truly unique and less-crowded destinations. Don't let the misconception that Europe is expensive deter you; Eastern Europe proves that amazing European adventures are well within reach.\n\n\"Save up to 90% on flights with these amazing deals: https://educdunet.com/\"\n\nFinding incredibly affordable places to fly to Europe is all about being strategic. Look beyond the obvious major airports and consider flying into smaller hubs or in neighboring countries with good train connections. And remember, the savings on the flight are just the beginning; the lower cost of living in places like Portugal and Eastern Europe truly maximizes your budget and allows you to experience more.\n\nAlright, we've covered North America and Europe. But the world is a vast place, brimming with incredible experiences just waiting to be had. It's time to look further afield, to continents that might seem daunting in terms of flight cost but actually offer some fantastic budget options, particularly if you're willing to do a little searching and be flexible with your travel dates. Figuring out the most affordable places to fly can take you to some unexpected and amazing corners of the globe.\n\nBeyond the Usual Suspects: Finding Affordable Flights to Asia and Beyond\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAsia. The sheer diversity of this continent is breathtaking, from bustling megacities to serene temples and stunning natural landscapes. For many, the thought of flying to Asia conjures up images of incredibly long flights and equally high prices. While some routes can indeed be expensive, there are definitely affordable places to fly amongst this vast and fascinating continent. The key often lies in targeting specific countries and being aware of airlines that specialize in longer, lower-cost routes or utilize connecting flights strategically.\n\n### Southeast Asia: A Backpackers' Paradise with Budget-Friendly Flights\n\nSoutheast Asia is practically synonymous with budget travel. It's been a backpacker haven for decades, and for good reason. The cost of living is incredibly low, making it possible to travel for extended periods without spending a fortune. And guess what? While flights from North America or Europe can still be a significant expense, you can often find surprisingly affordable places to fly to within Southeast Asia, especially if you're clever about your entry point and utilize budget airlines once you're in the region.\n\nThink about flying into major hubs like Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, or Singapore. While direct flights from distant origins might be costly, these hubs often serve as gateways with more competitive pricing due to increased airport traffic and airline competition. Once you're there, inter-country flights within Southeast Asia on carriers like AirAsia, Scoot, or Vietnam Airlines are incredibly cheap, allowing you to hop between countries like Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Indonesia for minimal cost. The combination of relatively affordable entry points and incredibly low costs on the ground makes Southeast Asia a perennial favorite for budget-conscious travelers seeking adventure and cultural immersion.\n\n### Colombia: South American Charm Without the Sky-High Prices\n\nWhen you think of affordable places to fly in South America, Colombia might not be the first country that comes to mind, but it absolutely should be! In recent years, Colombia has shed its challenging past and blossomed into a vibrant and welcoming destination that offers incredible value for money. While flights to South America in general can be on the pricier side, Colombia often stands out as a more affordable option compared to countries further south like Argentina or Chile.\n\nCities like Medellin and Bogota are served by several airlines, and competition on those routes can lead to reasonably priced fares, especially if you're flexible with your dates. Once you're in Colombia, your travel budget stretches incredibly far. The food is delicious and inexpensive, accommodation options range from budget hostels to comfortable guesthouses, and local transportation is very affordable. You can explore stunning landscapes, vibrant cities, and rich cultural experiences without needing to spend a fortune. Colombia offers a fantastic opportunity to experience the magic of South America on a budget.\n\nIt's pretty clear, isn't it? The world isn't just for the wealthy traveler. By looking beyond the obvious and considering destinations that offer a combination of affordable flights and a lower cost of living, you can open the door to incredible travel experiences without draining your savings. Finding the most affordable places to fly is just the first step in a truly budget-friendly adventure.\n\nOkay, so we've talked about *where* to go. But there's more to finding affordable flights than just picking the right destination. Think of it like training for a marathon – you need to prepare properly and use the right techniques to reach the finish line. The same goes for securing those coveted cheap flight tickets. It's not just about luck; it's about leveraging the tools and strategies available to you.\n\nYour Arsenal for Affordable Flights: Tools and Strategies to Nail That Deal\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinding the most affordable places to fly is one thing, but actually *securing* a cheap ticket to that destination is another skill entirely. It's like being a detective, gathering clues and using the right tools to track down the best deal. Thankfully, we live in an age where technology is on our side. There are incredible resources available that can help you compare prices, track fluctuations, and snag those bargain fares before they disappear. Don't just rely on one website or one search; broaden your net and use the smart tools available to you.\n\n### Flight Comparison Websites: Your Best Friend in the Search\n\nIf you're not using flight comparison websites, frankly, you're doing it wrong! Websites like Google Flights, Skyscanner, and Kayak are an absolute game-changer when it comes to finding affordable flights. Think of them as your personal flight shoppers, scouring the internet for the best deals across multiple airlines and booking platforms.\n\nHere's why they're so crucial:\n\n- **Comparing Prices at a Glance:** Instead of checking individual airline websites (which would take forever!), these sites show you a wide range of options and prices side-by-side. It's like having a marketplace of flights, making it easy to spot the cheapest fares.\n- **Tracking Price Fluctuations:** Many comparison sites offer price alerts. You can set up notifications for specific routes, and they'll ping you when the price goes up or down. This is invaluable for timing your booking perfectly.\n- **Flexible Search Options:** Don't have a specific date in mind? No problem! Most comparison tools allow you to search for flights across an entire month or even year, showing you the days with the lowest fares. This flexibility is key to finding the most affordable places to fly at the most affordable time.\n- **Exploring \"Everywhere\":** Feeling adventurous but not sure where to go? Some sites have an \"Explore Everywhere\" feature. You set your departure city, and it shows you the cheapest places to fly to from that location. It's a fantastic way to discover new, budget-friendly destinations you might not have considered.\n\nUsing these comparison sites religiously is one of the single best things you can do to significantly reduce the cost of your flights.\n\n### Being Flexible with Dates and Airports: The Golden Ticket to Savings\n\nOkay, this is arguably one of the *most* important pieces of advice when it comes to finding affordable flights: be as flexible as possible. Rigidity with your travel dates or the specific airport you use can seriously limit your options and increase the price.\n\nThink about it this way:\n\n- **Flex Your Dates:** Flying just a day or two earlier or later can sometimes save you hundreds of dollars, especially if you're able to avoid peak travel days like Fridays or Sundays. Those flight comparison websites I mentioned earlier? Use their calendar views to easily spot the cheapest days to fly.\n- **Consider Nearby Airports:** Major cities often have multiple airports. While flying into the main international hub might be convenient, check the prices for smaller or secondary airports in the area. Sometimes, flying into an airport slightly further away and taking a short train or bus ride to your final destination can be significantly cheaper. This is particularly true when looking for the most affordable places to fly in Europe, where regional airports are common and well-connected.\n- **Shoulder Season Sweet Spot:** Traveling during the shoulder seasons (spring and fall) is often the perfect balance between good weather, fewer crowds, and significantly lower prices compared to the peak summer months or holiday seasons. It’s a savvy traveler's secret weapon for affordability.\n\nBeing flexible with dates and airports is like unlocking a secret door to cheaper flights. It might require a little extra planning, but the savings can be substantial.\n\nFinding the most affordable places to fly is a skill, and like any skill, it gets better with practice. By utilizing the right tools and adopting a flexible mindset, you're well on your way to making those travel dreams a reality without needing to take out a second mortgage.\n\nLet's just pause for a second. It's easy to get caught up in the excitement of finding a cheap flight, right? But it's important to remember that the flight is just one part of the overall travel cost. To truly have a budget-friendly trip, you need to consider the cost of being there as well. That's where things like accommodation, food, transportation, and activities come into play. Picking a destination where the cost of living is low significantly amplifies the savings you made on your flight, truly making it one of the most affordable places to fly *and* travel.\n\n\"Save up to 90% on flights with these amazing deals: https://educdunet.com/\"\n\nBeyond the Airfare: Making Your Entire Trip Affordable\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinding the most affordable places to fly is brilliant, don't get me wrong. It's the first crucial step. But a cheap flight to an expensive country is still, well, expensive overall! To truly stretch your travel budget and make your trip sustainable, you need to think holistically about the costs. The destinations we've discussed earlier – Mexico, Portugal, Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, and Colombia – work so well because they offer that sweet spot of affordable airfare *and* a lower cost of living once you arrive. But even if you land in a slightly more expensive destination on a great flight deal, there are still tons of ways to keep your costs down on the ground.\n\n### Affordable Accommodation Options: Beyond the Fancy Hotel\n\nLet's be honest, hotel rooms can eat up a huge chunk of your travel budget faster than you can say \"room service.\" But guess what? You don't *have* to stay in a fancy, overpriced hotel to have a comfortable and memorable trip. There are so many fantastic and affordable accommodation options available these days, catering to different travel styles and budgets.\n\nConsider these alternatives:\n\n- **Hostels:** Don't let outdated stereotypes fool you! Modern hostels are clean, safe, and incredibly social. Private rooms are often available if dorms aren't your thing, and they typically offer communal kitchens (great for saving money by cooking some of your own meals!) and organized activities. They're fantastic for meeting other travelers and getting local tips.\n- **Airbnb and Vacation Rentals:** Renting an apartment or room through platforms like Airbnb can be a lifesaver for your budget, especially if you're traveling with others or for a longer period. Having access to a kitchen is a massive money-saver, and you often get a more authentic local experience.\n- **Guesthouses and Homestays:** In many parts of the world, particularly in Asia and Latin America, guesthouses and homestays offer comfortable and affordable accommodation, often run by friendly local families. It's a wonderful way to experience the local culture firsthand.\n- **House Sitting:** Feeling adventurous? House sitting involves looking after someone's home (and often their pets!) while they're away, in exchange for free accommodation. It requires planning and flexibility, but it can lead to incredible experiences and zero accommodation costs.\n\nBy exploring these alternatives to traditional hotels, you can free up significant funds to spend on experiences, food, or even another trip!\n\n### Savvy Eating: Delicious and Budget-Friendly Food\n\nFood is an essential part of the travel experience, right? You want to try local dishes, experience different flavors, and immerse yourself in the culinary scene. But eating out for every single meal can add up quickly. The good news is that delicious and authentic food doesn't have to be expensive, especially in destinations that are already on our list of the most affordable places to fly *to*.\n\nHere's how to eat well on a budget:\n\n- **Embrace Street Food:** In many cultures, street food is not only incredibly delicious but also incredibly cheap. Think tacos in Mexico, pad thai in Thailand, or pierogi in Poland. It's a fantastic way to sample local flavors and interact with vendors. Just make sure you choose vendors with a high turnover and good hygiene practices.\n- **Hit the Local Markets:** Visiting local markets is a feast for the senses and a great place to pick up fresh produce, snacks, and sometimes even prepared food for a fraction of the cost of restaurants.\n- **Cook Some Meals:** If your accommodation has a kitchen, take advantage of it! Buying groceries and cooking some of your own meals is a significant money-saver, especially for breakfast and lunch. You can also pack snacks to avoid impulse buys while you're out exploring.\n- **Look for Local Eateries:** Avoid the tourist traps and seek out restaurants packed with locals. These places are usually more affordable, offer more authentic food, and give you a glimpse into the local culture. Ask your accommodation host or locals for recommendations.\n- **Take Advantage of Lunch Specials:** Many restaurants offer cheaper lunch menus than dinner. If there's a particular restaurant you want to try, consider going for lunch instead of dinner to save some cash.\n\nEating well on a budget is all about being mindful and seeking out local, affordable options. It's a fun challenge and a great way to connect with the local culture through its food.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to travel smartly and affordably, allowing you to experience more of the world without needing to win the lottery. By combining the strategy of finding the most affordable places to fly with smart budgeting on the ground, you can turn your travel dreams into reality. So, where will your next budget-friendly adventure take you? The possibilities are endless!\n\nThink back to that feeling of scrolling through those travel photos, that yearning for adventure.

I was also able to optimize the itinerary to reduce all non-overnight trains from a maximum of 4hrs to 3hrs.

Your plan could go sideways if a train gets cancelled for whatever reason and you have to stay another day. \n\nAlso you are going to be exhausted and probably burn through a pair of shoes. I’ve spent years of my life living in Europe and walking an average of 300 miles a month and I think this would be tough on me.",
      "It feels like you're trying to tick off as many boxes as possible, leaving you no time to enjoy a place and really experience any. Not everything is city-orientated so often you need to go out into the countryside to get the best of a place (Provence, Tuscany). Try to do less to 'do' more. You're going to be knackered after a week or two!\n\nSimilarly, going for 90 days in Schengen is risky, you're moving about so much that there's no buffer yet a high likelihood that a train will get cancelled or delayed and you'll end up out of sync with the plan or something won't work out due to local holidays or something. I'm not sure what your reasons are for wanting to be there, but I would drop nights in Milan and Nice, potentially leave out Mallorca and Madrid too as nice places as they are.\n\nPut another way, there's so much to see and do in Europe that you're missing out one way or the other, even along your route, and here you're trying to cram in so much that you'll 'do Europe' for the photo opportunity without actually 'doing' much! Relax a little, and enjoy a place more. Europe isn't a theme park to run from one ride to the next, it's a way of life and with so much time you should just relax a little and try to soak it up more.",
      "I'm not sure I'd plan the whole 3 months up front. Maybe plan the first month and while you're there see how you feel and what you want next? Like, what if you find out during month one that the pace or the destinations are not your jam but you've locked in the next two months already?",
      "I would leave some unplanned gaps between my confirmed plans. Also, like a DJ mixing some fast and slow pieces, I would have some small town experiences, particularly in places like Tuscany, between the big places. You mention Lucca, but go smaller, try Montepulciano or Montalcino. You mention a day trip to Sintra, but consider staying in Sintra, Also consider Obidos, Evora or Coimbra.",

    "text": "यूरोप कॉलिंग (Europe Calling)! Snagging Those Cheap Flights to Europe From LAX\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo, you've got that itch, huh? That undeniable pull towards cobblestone streets, ancient castles, museums overflowing with masterpieces, and cafes where you can just… *be*. Europe. It’s a continent steeped in history, culture, and enough delicious food to make your taste buds sing. But let's be honest, getting there from the West Coast, specifically Los Angeles (LAX), can feel like you’re buying a small country. Fear not, my fellow traveler! While the initial price tag might make your eyes water, snagging cheap flights to Europe from LAX is absolutely doable. It just takes a little know-how, some patience, and maybe a touch of good luck. We’re going to dive deep into the world of transatlantic budget travel from sunny Southern California, uncovering all the tips, tricks, and insider secrets to get you across the pond without breaking the bank. Think of this as your personal treasure map to affordable adventures!\n\n### Why Europe? Why Now? And Why the Heck From LAX?\n\nBefore we even start talking about prices, let's ponder the ‘why’. Why the burning desire for Europe right this minute? Maybe you're dreaming of sipping espresso on a Roman piazza as the sun rises. Perhaps you envision yourself hiking through the Swiss Alps, the crisp air filling your lungs and stunning vistas stretching out before you. Or maybe you just really, really need a dose of that old-world charm that Europe serves up in spades. Whatever your reason, it's a good one. And why from LAX? Well, for millions of us, it's our home turf. It's where we catch our flights, where our journeys begin. Sure, we could drive up to San Francisco or fly to New York first, but that just adds more layers of complexity and cost, doesn't it? We want to find those direct-ish routes and clever connections that get us from the Pacific shores straight to the European postcard. It's about making this dream a reality, and that starts with tackling that big, bad beast of a flight cost.\n\n#### The Allure of the Old Continent (and the Reality of Transatlantic Fares)\n\nEurope has captivated imaginations for centuries, and the reasons are as varied as the people who live there. From the vibrant nightlife of Berlin to the serene beauty of the Scottish Highlands, there's a corner of Europe for every soul. We romanticize it, and rightly so! But the reality of flying from a major hub like LAX to Europe is that it's a long haul, and airlines know they can charge a premium for that convenience and distance. You're looking at a journey of around 10-11 hours minimum, and that kind of airtime comes with a price tag. However, this doesn't mean those \"cheap flights to Europe from LAX\" are a myth. They’re more like hidden gems, waiting to be unearthed by the savvy traveler.\n\n### The Hunt is On: Your Arsenal for Finding Cheap Flights to Europe From LAX\n\nOkay, now for the nitty-gritty. You're armed with your European dream, you're departing from LAX, and you're ready to find those elusive cheap flights. Think of yourself as a detective, a digital nomad searching for the best possible deals. The internet is your playground, and there are a plethora of tools at your disposal. Forget blindly searching on one airline's website. We need to be strategic, casting a wide net and employing a variety of techniques. It’s all about being flexible and knowing where to look. Ready to load up your arsenal? Let's do this!\n\n#### Tools of the Trade: Websites and Apps to Become Your Best Friends Forever\n\nGone are the days of calling up airlines or travel agents one by one. Bless their hearts, but the digital age has revolutionized flight searching. There are some seriously powerful websites and apps out there that can scan millions of flight combinations in seconds, alerting you to price drops and highlighting the cheapest options. Consider these your new best friends when it comes to finding cheap flights to Europe from LAX:\n\n- **Google Flights:** This is often my first stop. It’s incredibly intuitive, allows you to explore different dates and destinations easily, and has a great calendar view that shows you the cheapest days to fly. It also lets you track prices, which is super handy!\n- **Skyscanner:** Another powerhouse in the flight-searching world. Skyscanner is known for its \"Everywhere\" search feature, which can be brilliant if you're flexible on your European destination. Just type in LAX and \"Everywhere\" and see where the cheapest points of entry are.\n- **Kayak:** Kayak is a great aggregator, pulling prices from various sources. They also have cool features like price prediction, which gives you an idea of whether prices are likely to go up or down.\n- **Momondo:** Momondo often finds some unique flight combinations, sometimes including lesser-known airlines or routes. It’s worth checking out once you’ve got a few options from the others.\n- **Hopper (App):** This app is fantastic for watching prices. You tell it your route and dates, and it will notify you when prices drop or rise. It also gives recommendations on whether to book now or wait.\n\nUsing a combination of these tools is key. Don't rely on just one! Each one has slightly different algorithms and access to different data, so cross-referencing is a must.\n\n### Timing is Everything: When to Hit the \"Book\" Button for Those Cheap Flights to Europe From LAX\n\nYou’ve heard the saying, \"timing is everything,\" right? Well, in the world of flight booking, especially for long-haul flights like those from LAX to Europe, it's not just an adage, it's gospel. The difference between booking at the right time and the wrong time can add hundreds, sometimes even thousands, of dollars to your fare. Airlines are masters of dynamic pricing – they adjust prices based on demand, season, and even seemingly random factors. Understanding these patterns is crucial for snagging those coveted cheap flights to Europe from LAX. It’s a delicate dance between booking too early and booking too late.\n\n#### The Goldilocks Zone: Not Too Early, Not Too Late, But Just Right\n\nSo, when is the magical time to book your cheap flights from LAX to Europe? While there's no rock-solid, guaranteed answer (airlines love to keep us on our toes!), there are definitely windows of opportunity. Generally speaking, for international flights like this, the Sweet Spot often falls somewhere between **2 to 5 months before your departure date**.\n\n- **Booking too early (more than 6 months out):** You might not see the discounted fares yet. Airlines are often testing the waters with higher prices initially.\n- **Booking too late (less than 2 months out):** Prices tend to skyrocket as the departure date approaches and demand increases. Airlines know you're likely desperate and willing to pay more.\n\nWithin that 2-5 month window, pay attention to fluctuations. Set price alerts on your chosen flight search engines and watch the trends. Sometimes there are random dips in price that you can take advantage of.\n\n#### Avoiding Peak Season: The Obvious, But Often Ignored, Rule\n\nThis might seem like a no-brainer, but it's astonishing how many people forget this simple truth: flying to Europe in the peak summer months (June, July, August) is almost always going to be more expensive. Everyone wants to go when the weather is warmest and schools are on break. If your travel dates are flexible, targeting the shoulder seasons is your best bet for finding cheap flights to Europe from LAX.\n\n- **Shoulder Seasons:** Think Spring (April-May) and Fall (September-October). The weather is often still pleasant, the crowds are thinner, and importantly, the flight prices tend to be significantly lower.\n- **Winter Travel:** If you don't mind bundling up, winter travel (excluding the Christmas and New Year's holidays) can offer some of the lowest fares. Think cozy Christmas markets (if you hit them in November/early December) or exploring museums without the throngs of tourists.\n\nFlexibility with your travel dates, even by just a few days, can make a world of difference. Play around with the calendar views on flight search engines to see how prices change from one day to the next.\n\n### Location, Location, Location: Thinking Beyond the Obvious European Hubs\n\nWhen you think of flying to Europe, your mind might immediately jump to the big, glamorous cities: London, Paris, Rome. And while those are certainly fantastic destinations, they are also major international hubs, and flying directly to them from LAX can often come with a higher price tag. To find those cheap flights to Europe from LAX, sometimes you need to get a little creative with your arrival city.\n\n#### The Power of Secondary Airports and Budget Airline Connections\n\nInstead of aiming for the heart of a major European capital, consider flying into a slightly smaller, often less-glamorous, but much cheaper, airport. These are often served by budget airlines within Europe, and the savings on your transatlantic flight can more than make up for the cost of a connecting flight or train to your final destination.\n\nConsider these strategies:\n\n- **Fly into a major European budget airline hub:** Think places like Dublin (Ryanair), London Stansted or Gatwick (EasyJet and others), or various airports in Germany or Spain.\n- **Look for flights to less popular gateway cities:** Lisbon, Portugal, for example, can sometimes be a cheaper point of entry from LAX than, say, Madrid or Barcelona.\n- **Factor in the cost of onward travel:** While you might save on the initial flight, remember to budget for the cost of the connecting flight, train, or bus to your ultimate destination. Sometimes the convenience of a direct flight, even if slightly more expensive, is worth the extra cost. Do the math!\n\nThink of it like this: your goal is to get across the Atlantic as cheaply as possible. Once you’re there, hopping between European cities on budget airlines or trains is significantly more affordable than your initial jump from LAX.\n\n### The Art of the Layover: Turning a Necessary Evil into an Opportunity\n\nLong-haul flights from LAX to Europe almost always involve a layover. While the thought of adding extra hours to your journey might not be thrilling, layovers can actually be your friend when it comes to finding cheap flights to Europe from LAX. Direct flights are often the most convenient, but they are also typically the most expensive. Embracing a layover, or even planning a deliberately longer one, can sometimes unlock significant savings.\n\n#### Strategic Stops: Where and How Long Can Save You Money\n\nWhen searching for flights, pay attention to the layover locations and durations. Connecting flights are often cheaper because they are less direct and take longer. Airlines sometimes use these routes to fill planes or offer more competitive fares.\n\n- **Look for flights with one layover:** While two layovers might be even cheaper, the added time and potential for delays might not be worth the savings for everyone. One layover in a major hub like Heathrow, Charles de Gaulle, or Amsterdam Schiphol is pretty standard for LAX-Europe flights.\n- **Consider deliberately longer layovers:** Some airlines offer itineraries with extended layovers (think 8+ hours). While this might seem like a drag, it can actually be an opportunity to briefly explore a new city! Some airports even offer free city tours for passengers with long layovers. Just make sure you check visa requirements for the layover country.\n\nNegotiating the layover landscape effectively can seriously impact the cost of your cheap flights to Europe from LAX. Don't automatically filter out flights with layovers – you might be missing out on a fantastic deal!\n\n\"Save up to 90% on flights with these amazing deals: https://educdunet.com/\"\n\n### Flexibility is Your Superpower: Embracing the Unknown for Cheaper Fares\n\nI’ve mentioned flexibility a few times already, but it bears repeating because it is, without a doubt, one of the most powerful weapons in your arsenal for finding cheap flights to Europe from LAX. The more rigid you are with your dates, times, and destinations, the fewer options you'll have, and the more you're likely to pay. Think of flexibility as your superpower – it allows you to adapt and take advantage of opportunities as they arise.\n\n#### Dates, Times, and Destinations: The Trifecta of Flexibility\n\nLet’s break down where flexibility can really pay off:\n\n1. **Flexible Travel Dates:** This is the big one. As discussed before, even shifting your departure or return date by a few days can drastically change the price. Use the calendar view on search engines to visualize this. Mid-week flights are often cheaper than weekend travel.\n2. **Flexible Departure/Arrival Times:** Red-eye flights (overnight flights arriving in the morning) or very early morning departures are often less popular and therefore cheaper. If you can handle a less-than-ideal flight time, you might save a bundle.\n3. **Flexible European Destination:** We touched on this earlier, but being open to flying into different European cities can unlock significant savings. Instead of being fixated on, say, Rome, consider flying into Milan or Budapest and then taking a train or budget flight onwards.\n\nBy being open to these variables, you increase your chances of stumbling upon those coveted cheap flights to Europe from LAX. It’s a mindset shift, but one that can pay off handsomely in your wallet.\n\n### The World of Budget Airlines: Friend or Foe When Flying From LAX?\n\nOkay, let's talk about the elephants in the room: budget airlines. Within Europe, airlines like Ryanair and EasyJet have revolutionized air travel, making it incredibly affordable to hop between countries. But what about flying *to* Europe from LAX? Can budget airlines play a role in getting us across the pond cheaply? The answer is… complicated, but yes, sometimes.\n\n#### The Transatlantic Budget Airline Landscape (and the Fine Print)\n\nHistorically, true budget airlines flying transatlantic routes from LAX were rare. However, in recent years, a few players have emerged, attempting to disrupt the traditional airline model. Think airlines like Norse Atlantic Airways or, historically, WOW Air (RIP).\n\nHere’s the catch with these transatlantic budget carriers:\n\n- **Bare-Bones Fares:** Their headline prices are often incredibly low, but that's just for the absolute basics. Everything else costs extra: checked baggage, carry-on baggage (often anything more than a small personal item), seat selection, food and drinks, blankets, pillows… you get the idea.\n- **Limited Routes:** They typically operate on specific, often less frequent, routes. You might not find a direct flight to your desired city.\n- **Potential for Service Issues:** While many budget airlines are reliable, they can sometimes have less flexibility in case of delays or cancellations compared to legacy carriers.\n\nHowever, if you're a minimalist packer, don't mind bringing your own snacks and entertainment, and are just focused on getting from point A to point B at the lowest possible price, these budget transatlantic airlines *can* offer incredibly cheap flights to Europe from LAX. Just make sure you factor in all the potential add-on costs before comparing them to a legacy airline fare. Sometimes the \"cheap\" fare ends up being more expensive once you add everything you need.\n\n### The Hidden Costs: Beyond the Ticket Price\n\nYou’ve found a seemingly amazing deal on cheap flights to Europe from LAX! You’re practically patting yourself on the back. But hold on just a second there. Before you hit \"book,\" it’s critical to factor in all the *other* costs associated with your flight. The headline price is just one piece of the puzzle. Ignoring these can turn a seemingly cheap flight into a not-so-cheap one.\n\n#### Factor in the Fees: The Unsung Heroes of the Airline Balance Sheet\n\nAirlines, particularly budget ones, love their fees. They are a significant source of revenue, so you need to be aware of them to accurately calculate the true cost of your cheap flights to Europe from LAX.\n\nHere are some common fees to watch out for:\n\n- **Baggage Fees:** As mentioned, this is a major one, especially on budget airlines. Check the airline's baggage policy *before* you book. Know the size and weight limits for both checked and carry-on bags. Overages can be incredibly expensive at the airport.\n- **Seat Selection Fees:** Airlines will often charge you extra to choose your seat. If you don't pay, you'll likely be assigned a random seat at check-in, which might mean being separated from your travel companions.\n- **Food and Drink:** On most long-haul flights, even on legacy carriers, complimentary meals are increasingly becoming a thing of the past in economy. Budget for buying food on the plane or, better yet, bring your own.\n- **Travel Insurance:** While not an airline fee, travel insurance is a crucial \"hidden\" cost to consider. It can protect you in case of trip cancellations, delays, medical emergencies, and lost luggage. It's an investment worth making, especially for a long international trip.\n- **Airport Transfers:** How will you get from the European airport to your accommodation? Factor in the cost of trains, buses, taxis, or ride-sharing services.\n\nDon't get blindsided by these extra costs. Do your research and factor them into your overall travel budget to ensure those cheap flights to Europe from LAX are genuinely cheap.\n\n### Loyalty Programs and Credit Cards: Leveraging Your Existing Resources\n\nYou know those points and miles you've been accumulating? Now’s the time to put them to work! Loyalty programs from airlines and travel-focused credit cards can be incredibly valuable tools for reducing the cost of your flights, potentially helping you score cheap flights to Europe from LAX or significantly offset the price.\n\n#### Points, Miles, and Perks: Make Your Spending Work For You\n\nIf you’re a frequent flyer or have a travel credit card, you might have a stash of points or miles sitting there just waiting to be used. Here’s how they can help:\n\n- **Redeem for Flights:** The most direct way to use points and miles is to redeem them for flights, either fully or partially. Award availability for transatlantic flights can be tricky to find, especially in peak season, but it's worth checking if your points can cover your trip.\n- **Upgrade Your Seat:** While not strictly about getting a cheaper ticket, using points or miles to upgrade to a more comfortable cabin (premium economy, business class) can make a long flight a much more pleasant experience, especially on those overnight flights from LAX to Europe.\n- **Airline Alliances:** Airlines belong to alliances (like Star Alliance, Oneworld, and SkyTeam). You can often earn and redeem miles across alliance partners. This expands your options for using your points.\n- **Credit Card Travel Portals:** Many travel credit cards have their own travel portals where you can book flights using your points. Sometimes, the value of your points is higher when booked through their portal.\n- **Credit Card Perks:** Travel credit cards often come with perks like free checked bags (which can save you a significant amount), airport lounge access (making layovers much more comfortable), and travel insurance.\n\nUsing your existing loyalty resources effectively can be a game-changer in your quest for cheap flights to Europe from LAX. Don't let those points and miles gather dust!\n\n### Setting Alerts and Being Proactive: The Early Bird Gets the Worm (Sometimes)\n\nFinding cheap flights to Europe from LAX often requires a bit of forward planning and a proactive approach. You can’t just check prices once and assume you’ve seen the best they have to offer. Prices fluctuate constantly, and staying on top of those changes is key.\n\n#### The Waiting Game: Setting Price Alerts and Monitoring the Market\n\nOnce you have a general idea of your desired travel dates and potential destinations, the best thing you can do is set up price alerts. Most major flight search engines (Google Flights, Skyscanner, Kayak) allow you to do this.\n\n- **How Price Alerts Work:** You tell the system your desired route and dates, and it will email or notify you when the price changes significantly. This is crucial because it allows you to jump on a good deal as soon as it appears.\n- **Monitor Consistently:** Don't just set an alert and forget about it. Check prices periodically yourself, even if you have alerts set up. Sometimes you might spot a trend or a deal that the automated system misses.\n- **Be Prepared to Book:** When you receive a notification about a price drop that looks good, be prepared to book quickly. Good deals, especially on popular routes like LAX to Europe, can disappear fast.\n\nBeing proactive, setting those alerts, and monitoring the market are essential steps in your journey to finding those elusive cheap flights to Europe from LAX. It's a bit of a waiting game, but it can be well worth the patience.\n\n### Alternative Strategies: Thinking Outside the Box for Your Transatlantic Journey\n\nWhile the standard flight search methods are your bread and butter, sometimes thinking a little outside the box can reveal even more opportunities for snagging cheap flights to Europe from LAX. These might require a bit more effort or flexibility, but the potential savings can be significant.\n\n#### The Road Less Traveled: Open-Jaw Tickets, Positioning Flights, and Package Deals\n\nHere are a few alternative strategies to consider:\n\n- **Open-Jaw Tickets:** This is where you fly into one city and fly out of another. For example, fly into Paris and fly out of Rome. Sometimes, airlines offer \"open-jaw\" fares that are cheaper than booking two separate one-way flights. This is especially useful if you're planning to travel between European cities by train or budget flight.\n- **Positioning Flights:** This involves booking a separate, often cheaper, flight to a different US city from which you can then catch a cheaper international flight to Europe. For example, flying from LAX to New York might be inexpensive, and then a flight from New York to Europe might be cheaper than the direct LAX-Europe route. *However, be cautious here!* If your first flight is significantly delayed and you miss your international connection, you might be on your own as you booked separate tickets. This strategy comes with higher risk.\n- **Package Deals:** Sometimes, bundling your flight and accommodation together through a travel agency or website can result in a lower overall price than booking them separately. While this might not offer the absolute cheapest flight, the combined savings on flights and hotels can be substantial.\n- **Student and Youth Fares:** If you're a student or under a certain age (often 26), look into specialized student and youth travel agencies or websites. They often have access to discounted fares that aren't available to the general public.\n- **Using a Travel Agent (Yes, Really!):** While the internet has taken over much of travel booking, a good travel agent, especially one specializing in international travel, can sometimes find deals and itineraries that you might not find on your own. They can also be invaluable if things go wrong during your trip.\n\nThese alternative strategies require a bit more planning and research, but they can definitely help you on your mission to find cheap flights to Europe from LAX.\n\n### Common Pitfalls to Avoid: Don't Let Your Cheap Flight Dream Turn into a Nightmare\n\nYou've put in the work, you've found a seemingly amazing deal on cheap flights to Europe from LAX – huzzah! But relax just yet. There are still a few common pitfalls that can turn your dream trip into a bit of a headache (and cost you more money in the long run). Being aware of these can help you avoid unnecessary stress and expenses.\n\n#### Reading the Fine Print: The Details That Matter\n\nAirlines, especially budget ones, make their money on the details. Skipping over the fine print can lead to unpleasant surprises down the road.\n\n- **Baggage Allowance:** I can't stress this enough! Double-check the baggage allowance *before* you book, and *before* you pack. Weigh your bags at home! Paying for overweight or oversized bags at the airport is often incredibly expensive.\n- **Check-In Procedures:** Some airlines, especially budget ones, charge a fee if you don't check in online beforehand. Know the airline's check-in policy and adhere to it.\n- **Cancellation and Change Policies:** Understand the airline's policy regarding cancellations and changes. How much will it cost if you need to alter your plans? This is especially important if your travel dates aren't set in stone.\n- **Visa Requirements:** Do you need a visa for your destination country or any layover countries? This is YOUR responsibility to figure out. Don't assume you don't need one. Check the official government websites well in advance.\n- **Passport Validity:** Your passport needs to be valid for usually at least six months *after* your planned return date to the US. Check the requirements of your destination country. Renew your passport early if needed!\n- **Connecting Time:** If you've booked separate tickets (like using the positioning flight strategy), make sure you have ample connecting time. A tight connection, especially if you need to recheck bags or go through security again, can be very stressful.\n\nGetting cheap flights to Europe from LAX is only part of the equation; avoiding these pitfalls will ensure your trip remains affordable and stress-free.\n\n### Final Thoughts and Your European Adventure Awaits!\n\nPhew!

    "title": "Lax to Europe: Your Ultimate Guide for Affordable Travel and Tips",
    "text": "Ah, the glorious, sometimes maddening, quest to get from the sunny sprawl of Los Angeles International Airport, affectionately known as LAX, to the charming cobblestone streets and rich history of Europe! It's a journey many of us dream about, picturing ourselves sipping espresso in a Parisian cafe or admiring the Renaissance masterpieces in Florence. But let's be real, the reality of bridging that vast expanse of sky can be a bit… overwhelming. It’s not just about hopping on a plane; it’s about navigating routes, figuring out layovers, and, perhaps most importantly, finding a flight that doesn't require taking out a second mortgage. This article is your friendly guide, packed with insider tips and practical advice to help you conquer the LAX to Europe journey without losing your mind or your shirt. We'll delve into the nitty-gritty, explore your options, and hopefully, make planning this incredible adventure feel a whole lot less daunting and a whole lot more exciting!\n\nThe Great Escape: Planning Your LAX to Europe Odyssey\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nAlright, so you've got that burning desire to see Europe. Maybe it's the call of the ancient ruins, the allure of world-class cuisine, or simply the need for a change of scenery that stretches beyond the Pacific horizon. Whatever your motivation, the first hurdle is figuring out the logistics of getting from LAX to your European destination. It’s a long haul, and getting it right from the get-go can make all the difference between a smooth, enjoyable trip and a chaotic, stress-inducing nightmare. Think of yourself as an intrepid explorer, plotting your course across a vast ocean – except in this case, the ocean is the Atlantic, and your ship is a metal tube hurtling through the air.\n\n### Choosing Your Destination: Where the Old World Beckons\n\nEurope isn't a single entity; it's a vibrant tapestry of countries, cultures, and experiences, each vying for your attention. Deciding where you want to land dictates so much about your trip, from the flight paths available to the type of adventure that awaits you. Are you dreaming of the romantic canals of Venice, the bustling markets of London, the vibrant nightlife of Berlin, or the sun-drenched beaches of the Algarve? Pinpointing your desired landing zone is step one.\n\n- **Western Europe:** Think UK, France, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, etc. Often more direct flight options, but can be pricier. Great for well-trodden tourist paths and iconic landmarks.\n- **Central Europe:** Countries like Germany, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary. A fantastic blend of history, culture, and stunning architecture, often offering slightly more budget-friendly options.\n- **Southern Europe:** Italy, Greece, Turkey (partially in Europe), Croatia. Rich in history, delicious food, and beautiful coastlines. Can be very popular during peak season.\n- **Northern Europe:** Scandinavia, Iceland. Known for breathtaking natural beauty, unique cultures, and often higher costs of living.\n\nPicking your primary destination is like choosing your anchor point for the whole journey. It sets the stage for everything that follows. Don't feel pressured to see everything on your first trip; Europe is vast and deserves to be savored.\n\n### Seasonality and Timing: When to Embark\n\nThe time of year you decide to travel from LAX to Europe has a massive impact on everything from flight prices and crowds to the weather and availability of activities. Thinking about peak season, shoulder season, and off-season is crucial for both your budget and your overall experience.\n\n- **Peak Season (Summer: June - August):** The most popular time to visit, and for good reason! The weather is generally beautiful, and everything is open. However, expect huge crowds, higher prices for flights and accommodation, and the need to book well in advance. Think shoulder-to-shoulder at the Colosseum.\n- **Shoulder Season (Spring: April - May; Fall: September - October):** Many argue this is the sweet spot. Pleasant weather, fewer crowds than peak season, and often more reasonable prices. springtime brings beautiful bloom and fall offers stunning foliage.\n- **Off-Season (Winter: November - March):** Generally the cheapest time to fly and find accommodation. Great for seeing museums and indoor attractions without the throngs. However, some smaller towns or seasonal attractions might be closed, and the weather can be cold and wet in many areas. Think cozy cafes and fewer tourists.\n\nConsider what you want to do and see. If your dream is to wander through Christmas markets, December is your jam. If sunbathing on the French Riviera is the goal, summer is probably best (though expect company). For a balance of good weather, fewer crowds, and better prices, shoulder season is often the winning ticket. This isn't an exact science, of course, but keeping seasonality in mind can seriously impact your trip.\n\nNavigating the Skies: Your LAX to Europe Flight Options\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nOkay, so you know where you want to go and roughly when. Now comes the task of actually getting there. Flights from LAX to Europe are a beast of their own. It’s a long flight, typically ranging from 10 to 15+ hours depending on your destination and whether you have a direct flight or a layover. Understanding the different types of flights and airlines is key to finding the best option for you.\n\n### Direct vs. Connecting Flights: The Time-Saving vs. Budget Balancing Act\n\nThis is often the first major decision point when booking a flight from LAX to Europe. A direct flight, as the name suggests, takes you straight from Los Angeles to your European destination without any stops. A connecting flight involves at least one layover, sometimes two or even more.\n\n- **Direct Flights:** The obvious advantage here is speed and convenience. You board the plane in LA and debark in Europe. No worrying about missing connecting flights, navigating unfamiliar airports, or the hassle of multiple takeoffs and landings. The biggest drawback? They are almost always more expensive. Think of a direct flight as the express train – fast and efficient, but you pay a premium for it.\n- **Connecting Flights:** These are generally more budget-friendly, sometimes significantly so. They open up more route options and allow you to potentially choose layovers in cities you might be interested in exploring (if time allows!). The downside? They take longer, there's always the risk of delays causing missed connections, and navigating large international airports can be stressful, especially with luggage. Think of a connecting flight as the scenic route – it takes longer, but it might offer some interesting detours and save you some cash.\n\nFor a long-haul flight like LAX to Europe, a direct flight is definitely appealing for comfort and minimizing travel time. However, if your budget is a primary concern, a connecting flight is often the way to go. Just be sure to factor in enough layover time, especially if you're connecting through a very large or busy airport.\n\n### The Airline Landscape: Carriers Crossing the Atlantic\n\nA multitude of airlines operate flights from LAX to various destinations in Europe. They range from full-service legacy carriers to budget airlines and everything in between. Each has its own strengths, weaknesses, and, importantly, price points.\n\n1. **Legacy Carriers:** These are your major, well-established airlines like British Airways, Lufthansa, Air France, KLM, and American Airlines, United, Delta (often in partnership with European carriers). They typically offer a higher level of service, including checked baggage in the fare, in-flight entertainment, and meals. Their prices are usually on the higher side.\n2. **Budget Airlines:** While pure budget airlines like Ryanair and EasyJet primarily operate within Europe, you might find flights from LAX on carriers that offer more stripped-down service at lower prices. These often charge extra for things like checked bags, seat selection, and even water. Think Icelandair or even sometimes deals on major carriers operating on a budget model for certain routes.\n\nWhen comparing airlines, don't just look at the base fare. Consider what's included in the ticket price (checked baggage, meals, seat assignments) and factor those in. A seemingly cheaper ticket on a budget airline might end up costing more than a full-service carrier once you add on all the extras. It's like comparing a basic car model to one with all the bells and whistles – the upfront price is different, but the final cost can be surprising.\n\n### Finding the Best Deals: The Hunt for Affordable Flights\n\nLet's face it, flights to Europe from LAX can be expensive. Finding a good deal is often the difference between going on your dream trip and putting it off for another year. There are several strategies you can employ to increase your chances of snagging a reasonably priced ticket.\n\n- **Be Flexible with Your Dates:** This is perhaps the single biggest factor in finding cheaper flights. If you can be flexible with your departure and return dates by even a few days, you can often see significant price drops. Mid-week flights are usually cheaper than weekend departures and arrivals.\n- **Book in Advance (but not Too Early!):** Generally, booking a few months out (3-6 months for LAX to Europe flights) is a good strategy. Booking too early can mean you miss out on sales, while booking too last minute will likely result in sky-high prices. It's a bit of a sweet spot.\n- **Use Flight Comparison Websites:** Don’t just look at one airline's website. Utilize flight comparison engines like Google Flights, Skyscanner, and Kayak. These sites scour multiple airlines and routes to show you a range of options and prices.\n- **Set Price Alerts:** Many flight comparison websites allow you to set price alerts for specific routes and dates. You'll get notified when prices go up or down, allowing you to snatch up a deal when it appears.\n- **Consider Alternative Airports:** Flying into a smaller European airport and then taking a train or bus to your final destination can sometimes be cheaper than flying directly into a major hub. For example, flying into Manchester instead of London Heathrow, or into Beauvais instead of Paris Charles de Gaulle. Just be sure to factor in the cost and time of the onward journey.\n- **Look at Different Days of the Week:** Flying on Tuesdays and Wednesdays often tends to be cheaper than flying on Fridays or Sundays. Airlines know people like to travel on weekends, so they price accordingly.\n\nFinding a cheap flight from LAX to Europe requires a bit of effort and flexibility, but it's definitely achievable. Think of it as a treasure hunt – the best deals are out there, you just need to know where and how to look!\n\n### The Layovers: Making the Most of Your Stopover\n\nIf you opt for a connecting flight, your layover city can either be a tedious waiting game or an unexpected bonus. A long layover can actually be a fantastic opportunity to get a brief taste of another city and break up the long journey.\n\n- **Choose Your Layover City Wisely:** Some airports are more pleasant for long waits than others. Major hubs like London Heathrow, Frankfurt, and Paris Charles de Gaulle can be overwhelming, but they often have good amenities. Consider airlines that route through cities you might be interested in exploring, like Dublin on Aer Lingus, Amsterdam on KLM, or Reykjavik on Icelandair.\n- **Plan for Sufficient Layover Time:** Don't book connections that are too tight. A minimum of 1.5 to 2 hours is generally recommended for international connections, especially in large airports. If you're considering leaving the airport for a quick city tour, you'll need much longer – think 6-8 hours minimum, factoring in immigration, security, and travel time to and from the city center.\n- **Research Visa Requirements:** If you plan to leave the airport during a layover, make sure you understand the visa requirements for that country, even for a short visit. As a US citizen, you generally get visa-free entry into most Schengen Area countries for up to 90 days, but it's always best to double-check.\n- **Utilize Airport Amenities:** Even if you don't leave the airport, make the most of your layover. Explore the shops, find a comfortable spot to relax, or even book entry into an airport lounge for a more comfortable experience.\n\nA layover doesn't have to be a drag. With a little planning, it can be a mini-adventure in itself!\n\nPre-Departure Prep: Getting Ready for Your LAX to Europe Flight\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOkay, so you've booked your flight from LAX to Europe – high five! But before you can start dreaming of croissant-filled breakfasts and historic castles, there are a few crucial things to take care of. Being prepared before you even get to LAX can save you a lot of stress and hassle.\n\n### Passport and Visas: Your Golden Ticket (and Maybe More)\n\nThis might seem obvious, but it's worth repeating: make sure your passport is valid well beyond your planned return date. Many countries require your passport to be valid for at least six months after your intended departure date. Don't mess around with this; a last-minute rush to get a new passport is not fun.\n\nFor US citizens traveling to most European countries in the Schengen Area (which includes a large chunk of Western and Southern Europe), a visa is generally not required for stays up to 90 days within a 180-day period for tourism or business purposes. However, the European Union is introducing the ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorisation System) in the near future, which will be a pre-travel authorization similar to the ESTA for the US. Keep an eye out for when this comes into effect; you’ll need to apply and get approval *before* traveling.\n\nFor other European countries outside the Schengen Area (like the UK, Ireland, and some Eastern European nations), visa requirements can vary. Always check the official government websites of the countries you plan to visit for the most up-to-date information before you even think about booking your flight. Better safe than sorry, right?\n\n### Packing Smart: Less is More (Usually)\n\nPacking for a trip to Europe from LAX, especially for a longer stay, can be a challenge. You want to be prepared for different weather conditions and activities, but you also don't want to be lugging around a massive, unwieldy suitcase.\n\n- **Check Luggage Restrictions:** Every airline has different rules regarding checked and carry-on baggage size and weight limits. Be sure to check your airline's policy *before* you start packing to avoid expensive fees at the airport.\n- **Layers are Key:** European weather can be unpredictable, even in the warmer months. Packing layers allows you to adjust to changing temperatures throughout the day.\n- **Comfortable Footwear is Non-Negotiable:** You'll likely be doing a lot of walking in Europe. Invest in a good pair of comfortable walking shoes. Your feet will thank you.\n- **Travel Adapters:** European electrical outlets are different from those in the US. You’ll need a travel adapter to charge your electronics.\n- **Consider a Capsule Wardrobe:** Pack versatile items that can be mixed and matched to create different outfits. This helps you pack lighter while still having options.\n- **Don't Forget Medications and Essential Documents:** Keep any necessary medications in your carry-on luggage, along with copies of important documents like your passport, flight confirmations, and accommodation details.\n\nPacking effectively isn't just about fitting everything in; it's about packing smartly so you have what you need without being overburdened. Think of it like assembling a tactical travel kit – everything has a purpose.\n\n### Travel Insurance: An Essential Safety Net\n\nTraveling from LAX to Europe is a significant undertaking, and while you hope for the best, unforeseen events can happen. Travel insurance is arguably one of the most important things to purchase before your trip.\n\nTravel insurance can cover a range of situations, including:\n\n- **Trip Cancellation or Interruption:** If you have to cancel your trip due to illness, injury, or other covered reasons, travel insurance can reimburse you for non-refundable expenses.\n- **Medical Expenses:** Healthcare costs in Europe can be expensive for foreigners. Travel insurance can cover emergency medical treatment.\n- **Lost or Delayed Luggage:** If your luggage is lost, stolen, or delayed, travel insurance can help cover the cost of essential items and replacement of lost belongings.\n- **Travel Delays:** Some policies offer compensation for significant travel delays.\n\nDon't skip on travel insurance. It's a small investment that can save you a lot of money and stress if something goes wrong. Think of it as your personal safety net in case of unexpected bumps in the road.\n\nAt the Airport: Navigating LAX and Your European Gateway\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nLAX is a beast of an airport, and even experienced travelers can feel a little flustered navigating its terminals. Knowing a few tips and tricks can make your departure from LAX a smoother experience and arriving at a European airport a little less daunting.\n\n### Conquering LAX: Getting There and Checked In\n\nGetting to LAX can be an adventure in itself depending on traffic. Factor in plenty of extra time, especially during peak hours. Consider using ride-sharing services, taxis, or airport shuttles. Parking at LAX can be expensive, so research your options beforehand.\n\nOnce you're at the airport, have your e-ticket confirmation or mobile boarding pass ready. Many airlines offer online check-in 24 hours before your flight, which can save you time at the airport. If you have checked baggage, head to the baggage drop counter. Give yourself ample time – at least 3 hours for international flights from LAX is a good rule of thumb.\n\nNavigating security at LAX can also take time. Have your ID and boarding pass ready, and be prepared to remove electronics and liquids (following theTSA 3-1-1 rule for carry-on liquids).\n\n### Arriving in Europe: Immigration and Beyond\n\nThe feeling of landing in Europe after a long flight from LAX is pretty great! The process upon arrival typically involves immigration, baggage claim, and customs.\n\n- **Immigration:** Upon arrival, you'll go through immigration control. Have your passport ready. Be prepared to answer basic questions about the purpose of your visit and how long you plan to stay.\n- **Baggage Claim:** After immigration, head to the baggage claim area. Find the carousel number for your flight and wait for your luggage. If your bags don't appear, report it to the airline's baggage desk *before* leaving the baggage claim area.\n- **Customs:** In most cases, you'll just walk through the \"Nothing to Declare\" channel at customs unless you have items that need to be declared (like large amounts of cash or restricted goods).\n\nRemember, airport staff in Europe might have different procedures and customs than at LAX. Be patient and polite, and don't be afraid to ask for help if you're unsure about something.\n\n\"Save up to 90% on flights with these amazing deals: https://educdunet.com/\"\n\nMaking the Most of Your European Adventure (After the LAX to Europe flight!)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou've successfully made the journey from LAX to Europe – congratulations! Now it's time to truly embrace your adventure. Getting around Europe is a whole different ballgame than navigating Southern California, and understanding the transportation options is key to maximizing your time and experience.\n\n### Getting Around Within Europe: Trains, Planes, and Automobiles\n\nEurope has a fantastic and extensive public transportation system, making it relatively easy to get between cities and countries.\n\n- **Trains:** Rail travel is a popular and often scenic way to traverse Europe. High-speed trains connect major cities quickly and comfortably. For shorter distances, regional trains are a great option. Consider purchasing a rail pass if you plan on doing a lot of train travel.\n- **Budget Airlines:** For longer distances or if you're short on time, budget airlines within Europe offer cheap flights between many cities. However, remember to factor in extra costs for baggage and potential airport transfers.\n- **Buses:** Intercity buses are often the most budget-friendly option for getting around Europe. They can take longer than trains or planes, but they are a great way to see the countryside and save money.\n- **Car Rental:** Renting a car can be a good option if you plan to explore rural areas or have a specific itinerary that isn’t well-served by public transport. Just remember that driving styles and road rules can differ significantly from the US, and parking in European cities can be challenging and expensive.\n\nThink about your itinerary and budget when deciding on how to get around. A combination of these options is often the most effective way to see Europe.\n\n### Money Matters: Euros, Pounds, and Planning Your Budget\n\nThe currency used in Europe varies. The Euro (€) is the common currency in many European Union countries (the Eurozone), while others have their own currencies (like the British Pound in the UK, the Swiss Franc in Switzerland, etc.).\n\n- **Inform Your Bank:** Let your bank know you'll be traveling abroad to avoid having your cards blocked due to suspicious activity.\n- **ATMs are Your Friends:** ATMs (cash machines) are widely available throughout Europe and are often the best way to get local currency at a good exchange rate. Avoid using currency exchange booths at airports or tourist areas as they often have unfavorable rates.\n- **Credit Cards Widely Accepted:** Credit cards are widely accepted in most establishments, especially in cities. Just make sure your card has a chip (EMV) and ideally doesn't charge foreign transaction fees.\n- **Carry Some Cash:** It's always a good idea to have a small amount of the local currency on hand for small purchases or places that don't accept cards.\n\nPlan your budget before you go, considering accommodation, food, transportation, activities, and souvenirs. Research average costs in the cities you’ll be visiting to get a realistic picture. Europe can be done on a shoestring budget or as a luxurious splurge – it all depends on your choices. Budgeting effectively is key to a stress-free trip.\n\n### Communication and Connectivity: Staying in Touch\n\nStaying connected while traveling from LAX to Europe is important for safety, convenience, and sharing your awesome photos with friends and family back home.\n\n- **Unlock Your Phone:** If your phone is locked to your current carrier, you might consider getting it unlocked so you can use a local SIM card in Europe.\n- **International Roaming:** Your US phone carrier likely offers international roaming plans. These can be convenient but can also be quite expensive.\n- **Local SIM Card:** Purchasing a local SIM card upon arrival in Europe is often the cheapest option for data and local calls. You'll get a European phone number.\n- **eSIM:** Many newer phones support eSIMs, which are digital SIM cards. This allows you to purchase a data plan for Europe online before you even leave LAX.\n- **Wi-Fi Hotspots:** Wi-Fi is widely available in hotels, cafes, and public areas throughout Europe.\n\nHaving reliable connectivity makes navigating, using translation apps, and staying in touch so much easier. Don't leave this to chance!\n\nBeyond the Tourist Trail: Embracing the European Experience\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou've made the long journey from LAX to Europe. Now it's time to go beyond just seeing the major landmarks and truly immerse yourself in the local culture. This is where the real magic happens!\n\n### Food and Drink: A Culinary Adventure\n\nOne of the absolute highlights of traveling to Europe is the food! Forget everything you think you know; the flavors, ingredients, and dining customs are incredible and diverse.\n\n- **Embrace Local Cuisine:** Don't just stick to familiar dishes. Try the local specialties! Order that strange-sounding dish on the menu, seek out local markets, and ask for recommendations from locals.\n- **Cafes and Pastries:** European cafes are a way of life. Spend time people-watching with a coffee and a delicious pastry.\n- **Wine and Beer:** Sample the local wines and beers. Europe has a rich tradition of brewing and winemaking, and trying the regional varieties is a must.\n- **Dining Etiquette:** Familiarize yourself with basic dining etiquette in the countries you visit. For example, tipping customs can vary greatly.\n\nEating and drinking in Europe is more than just sustenance; it's a cultural experience. Be adventurous with your taste buds!\n\n### Culture and Customs: Avoiding Awkward Blunders\n\nWhile many European cultures share some similarities with the US, there are also important differences in customs and etiquette to be aware of.\n\n- **Basic Greetings:** Learning a few basic phrases in the local language (hello, please, thank you, excuse me) goes a long way and will be appreciated by locals.\n- **Meeting and Greeting:** Handshakes are common. In some countries, a kiss on each cheek (the number varies) is customary among friends and family.\n- **Punctuality:** Punctuality is generally valued, especially for appointments.\n- **Noise Levels:** Europeans tend to be more reserved in public spaces compared to Americans. Be mindful of your noise level in restaurants and on public transport.\n- **Shopping:** In many European countries, bagging your own groceries is common. Also, be prepared to pay a small fee for plastic bags.\n\nBeing aware of and respecting local customs shows cultural sensitivity and can make your interactions much smoother and more enjoyable. It's like stepping into someone else's home – you want to be a good guest, right?\n\n### Safety and Security: Staying Savvy on the Streets\n\nWhile Europe is generally safe for tourists, like any major tourist destination, petty crime can occur. Being aware of your surroundings and taking some basic precautions can help keep you and your belongings safe.\n\n- **Be Aware of Pickpockets:** Pickpocketing is a common issue in crowded tourist areas. Keep your valuables secure and out of sight. Consider using a money belt or a bag with secure closures.\n- **Be Wary of Scams:** Be aware of common tourist scams, such as people asking for signatures on petitions or street performers demanding excessive payment.\n- **Use Reputable Public Transport:** Stick to official taxis or ride-sharing services, and be aware of your belongings on crowded public transport.\n- **Keep Valuables Secure:** Don't leave valuables unattended in your car or hotel room.\n- **Know Emergency Numbers:** Familiarize yourself with the emergency number in the countries you are visiting (112 is the common emergency number in EU countries).\n\nTraveling smart and staying aware of your surroundings is key to a safe and enjoyable trip. Don't let fear overshadow your adventure, but a healthy dose of caution is always wise.\n\n\"Save up to 90% on flights with these amazing deals: https://educdunet.com/\"\n\nConclusion: Your European Adventure Awaits!\n-------------------------------------------\n\nPhew!

    "text": "Ah, Europe! The land of ancient history, breathtaking landscapes, and enough pasta to make your head spin. Just picturing yourself wandering through cobblestone streets, soaking in centuries of culture, or sipping a cappuccino by the Eiffel Tower, can make your heart flutter. But then reality bites, right? That little voice whispers, \"Los Angeles to Europe? That's gotta cost an arm and a leg!\" And let's be honest, airfare can be a real sticking point when planning your dream European getaway. So, the big question looms: how do you snag those coveted cheap deals going to Europe from LAX without emptying your savings account? It's totally doable, my friend, and I'm here to spill the beans on all the insider tips and tricks I've picked up over the years. Forget those sky-high prices you see on the first search results; there are ways to navigate the labyrinthine world of flight booking and emerge victorious, passport in hand, and wallet relatively unscathed. Let’s dive in and uncover the secrets to making that European adventure a reality without the financial hangover.\n\nUnearthing the Elusive Low Fares: Your Strategic Blueprint for a Steal\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinding affordable flights isn't just about luck; it's a strategic game, a treasure hunt of sorts. Think of yourself as a seasoned detective, piecing together clues to uncover the best possible price. It requires a bit of finesse, a willingness to be flexible, and definitely some savvy online sleuthing. This isn't the kind of undertaking you can tackle with a \"set it and forget it\" mentality. You've got to be engaged, proactive, and willing to explore different avenues. It's like fishing; you cast your line in various spots, hoping to reel in that big catch – in this case, a ridiculously cheap flight to Europe from LAX. Let's break down the essential strategies you need in your arsenal.\n\n### Be Flexible, My Friend: The Golden Rule Going to Europe From LAX\n\nHonestly, if there's one takeaway from this whole endeavor, it's flexibility. Being rigid with your travel dates is like trying to squeeze a square peg into a round hole when it comes to finding cheap flights. Airlines use dynamic pricing, meaning prices fluctuate based on demand, time of year, and even the day of the week. Flying on a Saturday is almost always going to cost more than flying on a Tuesday. Similarly, trying to fly during peak summer season or around major holidays? Good luck finding a bargain! Think about it: everyone and their dog wants to be in Europe at those times, driving prices through the roof.\n\n- **Shoulder Seasons are Your Bestie:** Aim for the shoulder seasons – spring (April to May) and fall (September to October). The weather is often still pleasant, tourist crowds are thinner, and crucially, flight prices tend to take a n nosedive compared to the summer frenzy. You might even stumble upon some fantastic deals right after the holiday rush in January and February.\n- **Midweek Magic:** Flying out and returning on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Thursdays can make a significant difference. Seriously, like, significant. Airlines sometimes have sales or lower prices during these less popular travel days. Consider it your weekday perk!\n- **Consider Red-Eyes:** While maybe not the most glamorous way to start your trip, red-eye flights, departing late at night and arriving early morning, can sometimes be cheaper. You lose a night of sleep, sure, but you gain a day in Europe and potentially save a bundle. Worth considering, right?\n- **Embrace Layovers (Sometimes):** Direct flights are convenient, absolutely. But sometimes, a longer layover or even a flight with two stops can drastically reduce the fare. Just make sure the layover isn't so long that it negates the savings.\n\nSo, before you even fire up those flight search engines, take a good hard look at your schedule and see where you can bend a little. A few days' difference could translate into hundreds of dollars saved, leaving you with more euros for gelato and souvenirs.\n\nThe Digital Detective Work: Mastering the Online Flight Search Landscape\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOkay, so you've embraced flexibility. Now what? Now, you become a digital detective. The internet is your oyster when it comes to finding flight deals, but like any good oyster, you need to know how to open it. There are a plethora of flight search engines out there, and while they all serve the same basic purpose, they each have their quirks and strengths. Using just one or two is like only checking one aisle of the supermarket for groceries. You're going to miss out on potential bargains. This is where your strategic approach really kicks in.\n\n### Going Beyond the Usual Suspects: Exploring Metasearch Engines for Bargains\n\nSure, you know the big names like Google Flights and Kayak, and they're fantastic tools, don't get me wrong. They aggregate data from tons of airlines and travel agencies, giving you a great overview. But sometimes, you gotta dig a little deeper. Think of flight search engines as different windows into the vast world of air travel. Each window shows you a slightly different perspective, and you need to peek through several to get the full picture. This is particularly true when you're trying to find how to find cheap deals going to Europe from LAX.\n\n- **Google Flights is Your Starting Point:** Seriously, Google Flights is a power player. Their calendar view is invaluable for seeing how prices fluctuate throughout the month (tying back to our flexibility point!). Plus, their \"Explore\" feature is amazing – you can see how much it costs to fly to different European cities during specific date ranges. So inspiring!\n- **Skyscanner for Broader Results:** Skyscanner is another excellent metasearch engine. They often pull results from smaller travel agencies that other sites might miss. Their \"Everywhere\" function is also brilliant if you're not tied to a specific destination; it shows you the cheapest places to fly to from LAX during your chosen dates. Talk about spontaneity!\n- **Momondo's \"Flight Insight\" is a Gem:** Momondo is known for its visually appealing interface and, more importantly, their \"Flight Insight\" section. This provides valuable data on when to book, which days are cheapest to fly on, and even which airports might be cheaper near your desired arrival city. Knowledge is power, especially when hunting for how to find cheap deals going to Europe from LAX.\n- **Hopper and Kayak for Price Alerts:** Hopper and Kayak are great for setting price alerts. If the price isn't right for your ideal dates, you can set an alert, and they’ll notify you when the fare drops. A passive, yet effective, strategy. Patience is a virtue in this game!\n\nRemember, don't just rely on the first price you see. Take the time to compare results across multiple sites. It might seem tedious, but that extra effort can seriously pay off. Think of it as a little investment of your time for a potentially huge return in savings.\n\nThe Underdog Airlines and Alternative Routes: Thinking Outside the Box for Savings\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSometimes, the cheapest way to get from point A to point B isn't the most obvious. Relying solely on major carriers flying direct routes can be like fishing in a crowded pond; the competition is fierce, and the pickings can be slim. To truly unearth those jaw-dropping deals, you need to be willing to consider alternative airlines and routes, even if they involve a little more effort or a less glamorous starting point. This is where thinking creatively comes into play, making it easier to find how to find cheap deals going to Europe from LAX.\n\n### Considering Low-Cost Carriers and Budget Airlines Across the Pond\n\nAlright, let's talk about budget airlines. While they might not offer all the bells and whistles of full-service carriers, they can offer incredibly low fares, especially for transatlantic routes. Think Norwegian (though their long-haul operations have changed), Play Airlines, and potentially even some combinations with European budget carriers once you're closer to the continent.\n\n- **Know the Trade-offs:** Be realistic about budget airlines. The low fare usually means à la carte pricing for everything else – checked bags, carry-on bags (beyond a small personal item), seat selection, food, drinks, etc. Factor these potential costs into your calculation. Sometimes, even with these add-ons, the total can still be significantly less than a full-service airline.\n- **Check Their Direct Websites:** Don't rely solely on metasearch engines for budget airlines. Sometimes, the best prices are found directly on their own websites.\n- **Consider Connecting Flights with Budget Carriers:** You might find a good deal on a major airline from LAX to a major European hub (like London, Paris, or Amsterdam), and then hop on a cheap flight with a European budget carrier (like Ryanair, EasyJet, or Vueling) to your final destination. This is sometimes called \"self-connecting\" and requires careful planning to ensure you have enough layover time and are aware of baggage transfer logistics. It's a bit trickier, but the savings can be substantial.\n\nIt's like putting together a puzzle; you might have to combine different pieces from different places to get the complete (and cheapest!) picture. Being open to these less conventional options can be a game-changer when trying to how to find cheap deals going to Europe from LAX.\n\nTiming is Everything: The Art of Booking Your Flight Strategically\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou've probably heard it before: there's a \"sweet spot\" for booking flights. Book too early, and you might miss out on sales. Book too late, and prices can skyrocket. It's a bit of a guessing game, played out against the backdrop of dynamic airline pricing. But while there's no magic universal formula, there are some general guidelines and indicators that can help you make an educated guess and increase your chances of securing a great deal, making it easier to find how to find cheap deals going to Europe from LAX.\n\n### When to Pull the Trigger: Identifying the Optimal Booking Window\n\nSo, when is the best time to actually book that ticket? While it varies, there are some patterns.\n\n- **The 1-3 Month Sweet Spot (Generally):** For international flights, including those from LAX to Europe, the general consensus is that booking somewhere between 1 and 3 months before your departure date is often the sweet spot. This gives airlines time to assess initial demand and potentially release sale fares.\n- **Avoid Last-Minute Booking:** Unless you're incredibly lucky and stumble upon a fire sale, booking within a few weeks of departure is usually a recipe for paying top dollar. Airlines know you're desperate and will price accordingly.\n- **Ignore the \"Mythical Tuesday\" Rule (Mostly):** While booking on Tuesdays used to be a popular tip, based on airlines releasing sales then, it's not as consistently true anymore with dynamic pricing. Focus more on *when* you fly (midweek) rather than *when* you book (specific day).\n- **Set Price Alerts (Again!):** This is where those price alerts come in handy. Start tracking fares for your desired dates and destinations a few months out. When you see a significant dip, and it feels like a good price based on your research, that might be the time to pounce. Don't wait *too* long hoping for an even lower price; sometimes those lowest fares are fleeting.\n\nIt's a bit like playing the stock market; you're trying to buy low and sell high (in this case, buy flights low!). Staying informed and being ready to jump when the price is right is key.\n\nLeveraging Points, Miles, and Loyalty Programs: The Frequent Flyer Advantage\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you're a frequent flyer, or even an occasional one who uses a specific credit card for travel, you might already have a secret weapon in your arsenal for finding affordable flights: points and miles. Leveraging these loyalty programs can significantly reduce the cash cost of your flight, sometimes even making it completely free! This is a serious advantage when trying to figure out how to find cheap deals going to Europe from LAX.\n\n### Unlocking Free or Discounted Flights with Airline and Credit Card Rewards\n\nAirline loyalty programs and travel-focused credit cards offer incredible opportunities to accumulate points or miles that can be redeemed for flights. If you're not already utilizing these, you're missing out on a huge potential for savings.\n\n- **Join Airline Loyalty Programs:** It costs nothing to join, and you'll earn miles on every eligible flight you take, regardless of how you paid for it. These miles can then be used for future flights or upgrades.\n- **Get a Travel Rewards Credit Card:** Many credit cards offer generous sign-up bonuses in points or miles, and you earn rewards on every dollar you spend. Find a card that aligns with your spending habits and travel goals. Just be sure to use it responsibly and pay off your balance to avoid interest charges that negate the rewards.\n- **Understand Airline Alliances:** Airlines are often part of global alliances (like Star Alliance, Oneworld, and SkyTeam). This means you can earn and redeem miles on partner airlines within the same alliance. For example, if you earn United miles (Star Alliance), you might be able to use them to fly Lufthansa to Europe.\n- **Search for Award Availability:** Finding award tickets (flights booked with miles) can sometimes be a bit trickier than booking with cash. You need to search for \"award availability\" on the airline's website. Be flexible with your dates and destinations, as award seats can be limited, especially for popular routes like LAX to Europe.\n- **Consider Transferable Points:** Some credit card points (likeChase Ultimate Rewards or American Express Membership Rewards) can be transferred to multiple airline partners. This flexibility can be invaluable, allowing you to take advantage of award sales or better availability with different airlines.\n\nBuilding up those points and miles takes time, but the payoff can be huge. Imagine using your accumulated miles to fly business class to Europe for a fraction of the cost! It's like free money for travel, and who doesn't love that?\n\nExploring Alternative Departure and Arrival Points: The Hub and Spoke Strategy\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhile Flying directly from LAX to your dream European city might be the most convenient option, it's not always the cheapest. Sometimes, the best deals involve a bit of a detour. Thinking about alternative departure and arrival airports can open up a whole new world of possibilities and potential savings. This is a clever tactic to find how to find cheap deals going to Europe from LAX without paying a fortune.\n\n### The \"Poor Man's Business Class\" and Other Multi-City Tricks For Savings\n\nThis strategy involves flying from LAX to a major European hub airport (like London Heathrow, Paris Charles de Gaulle, Amsterdam Schiphol, etc.) where competition is high and transatlantic fares might be lower. From there, you take a separate, often cheaper, flight on a budget airline to your final destination in Europe.\n\n- **Fly into a Major Hub, Then Connect on a Budget Airline within Europe:** As mentioned earlier, this \"self-connecting\" approach can save you a significant amount. Just be sure to leave plenty of time between flights at the hub airport – you'll need to clear immigration, collect your bags, and check in for your next flight (and potentially re-check your bags if you have them).\n- **Consider Flying Out of a Nearby Airport to LAX:** While less common for international flights, sometimes flying *to* a major airport near LAX, and *then* catching your international flight can be cheaper. This is a bit more niche, but worth considering if you find a really outlier deal.\n- **Look for Open-Jaw or Multi-City Tickets:** Instead of booking a round-trip ticket from LAX to one city, consider flying into one European city and flying out of another. This is called an \"open-jaw\" ticket. Or, you could book a multi-city itinerary that includes stops in several European cities. Sometimes, these can be surprisingly affordable and allow you to see more of Europe without backtracking.\n\nThis strategy requires a little more logistical planning, but the potential savings can make it well worth the effort. It's like taking a slightly longer, but more scenic and affordable, route to your destination.\n\nStaying Informed and Setting Yourself Up For Success: Essential Tools and Habits\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinding cheap flights isn't a one-time event; it's an ongoing process. To consistently snag the best deals, you need to stay informed about price fluctuations, airline sales, and new routes. Developing some smart online habits and utilizing the right tools can give you a significant advantage in your quest to find how to find cheap deals going to Europe from LAX.\n\n### Becoming a Flight Deal Hunter: Newsletters, Social Media, and Browser Extensions\n\nThe internet is a treasure trove of flight deal information if you know where to look.\n\n- **Subscribe to Flight Deal Newsletters:** Many websites and blogs specialize in finding and sharing amazing flight deals. Subscribe to their newsletters, and you'll get alerted to price drops and sales right in your inbox. Think of it as having personal flight deal scouts working FOR you!\n- **Follow Airlines and Deal Sites on Social Media:** Airlines often announce sales and promotions on their social media channels. Following them can give you early access to these deals. Similarly, many flight deal websites have active social media presences.\n- **Use Browser Extensions:** Some browser extensions can help you track flight prices, find historical price data, and even automatically apply discount codes.\n- **Clear Your Cookies (Sometimes):** While the impact of this is debated, some people believe that clearing your browser's cookies can prevent airlines and travel sites from tracking your searches and potentially inflating prices. It's a \"can't hurt, might help\" kind of strategy.\n\n\"Save up to 90% on flights with these amazing deals: https://educdunet.com/\"\n\n- **Be Patient and Persistent:** Finding a truly cheap flight takes time and effort. Don't get discouraged if you don't find a jaw-dropping deal immediately. Keep searching, set those alerts, and be ready to book when you see a price that meets your criteria.\n\nThink of yourself as a savvy shopper, always on the lookout for a bargain. By staying informed and utilizing the available resources, you increase your chances of finding that perfect flight at a price that feels like a steal.\n\nAvoiding Common Pitfalls and Unexpected Costs: Reading the Fine Print and Budgeting Wisely\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo, you’ve found a ridiculously low fare! High fives all around! But hold on a second. Before you hit that \"book now\" button in a frenzy of excitement, take a deep breath and do a little digging. Sometimes, those super-low prices can come with hidden costs or caveats that can quickly add up and negate your perceived savings. This is where being a smart consumer and reading the fine print is absolutely essential when you're figuring out how to find cheap deals going to Europe from LAX.\n\n### Decoding the Fine Print: Baggage Fees, Seat Selection, and Other Add-ons\n\nBudget airlines, in particular, are masters of the unbundled fare. They offer a low base price but then charge for everything else. Full-service carriers can also have fees for certain things, especially on their basic economy fares. Don't get caught off guard!\n\n- **Baggage Fees Are Crucial:** This is probably the biggest potential hidden cost. Check the airline's baggage policy *before* you book. Understand their rules for both checked and carry-on bags, including size and weight restrictions. Bringing an oversized carry-on on a budget airline can result in a hefty fee at the gate, turning your cheap flight into a not-so-cheap one.\n- **Seat Selection Costs:** Many airlines now charge extra to select your seat, especially on basic economy fares. If you want to guarantee sitting with your travel companions, or if you have specific seating preferences (like an aisle or window), be prepared to pay extra.\n- **Other Potential Fees:** Be aware of potential fees for things like printing your boarding pass at the airport, priority boarding, in-flight meals and drinks, and even using a specific form of payment.\n- **Read the Terms and Conditions:** I know, I know, nobody likes reading the fine print. But seriously, take a few minutes to glance over the airline's terms and conditions, especially for cancellation and change policies. Understanding the rules *before* you book can save you a lot of headaches and potential fees down the line.\n\nIt's like buying something on sale – you need to check the return policy! Being informed about potential additional costs allows you to build them into your budget and avoid any unpleasant surprises at the airport.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Finding Those Bargains: It's an Adventure!\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinding cheap deals going to Europe from LAX is definitely an adventure, a puzzle to be solved! It requires research, flexibility, patience, and a willingness to explore different options. But honestly, the feeling you get when you snag a fantastic deal on a flight to Europe is a reward in itself! It makes that dream trip feel even more attainable. Remember, it's not impossible to find affordable flights; it just takes a little effort and a smart approach.\n\n\"Save up to 90% on flights with these amazing deals: https://educdunet.com/\"\n\nThink of all those amazing European experiences waiting for you – the ancient ruins of Rome, the picturesque canals of Venice, the vibrant streets of Barcelona, the stunning castles of Germany.

I was in The Hague, and I had booked a Ryanair from Eindhoven to Morocco for the weekend, but I didn't want to give up the sunk cost of dozens of euros, so I took the subway + NS international + seven times of buses to the airport. I passed through Rotterdam, Breda, the Belgian enclave in the Dutch territory, and then crossed a Belgian town and finally returned to Eindhoven. I experienced traffic jams, delays, and missed connecting buses. It took a total of seven hours to get to the airport, plus the three and a half hours of the flight itself, which was a similar time for a direct flight to my faraway hometown (China)..\n \n I couldn’t help but thinking that if I were a person living in Eindhoven with a car, my schedule today would be: do whatever I want in the first six hours, then drive half an hour to the airport, and spend the last half an hour leisurely eating a burger combo at McDonald's lol.\n\n But the journey was also very educational for sure.

    "text": "I flew Manchester to Madrid a few days ago - plane delayed 45 minutes. Then today I did two separate flights to save money and I hoped would get me back to Manchester earlier on in the day than the return direct flight on offer (11:30pm arrival). First Madrid to Dublin (only 15 minutes delayed this time) and then Dublin to Manchester - a two hour delay for what is a 45 minute flight. I reached the gate to my flight to Manchester when I’m in Dublin and it has Alcante up, apparently they have changed the gate for this flight to Alicante and say Manchester is after, even though the Alicante flight was leaving around the same time as the Manchester flight. I then get told once the Alicante flight has boarded to go to another gate for the Manchester flight. Again, this is around the same time my original flight was meant to leave. So I go downstairs to that gate and I wait, and I wait. An hour after this ‘boarding’ starts. \n\nBut it doesn’t end. I have a backpack off Amazon that is the correct specifications to carry on for Ryanair. However, the lady who just took my passport and boarding pass says to me I need to put it in the measuring thing which I do and then she’s like no it’s sticking out at the front a bit but I’m like it’s doing that because there’s not much in it so distribution of it is doing this. I said I have just traveled from Madrid with Ryanair with no issues - she replied “well this is Dublin airport”. I eventually shake it a bit and take out things like my power bank and it fits easily and she lets me go. She then pulls up another guy behind me who has a small duty-free bag (gift chocolates) alongside his small suitcase on wheels and charges him the amount for an additional bag. Once I have gone through boarding, I then have to wait 20 to 30 minutes outside of the plane queuing while it was being cleaned (I guess it was but I have no idea why it took so long it’s a small plane) in order to board. I have just come from Spain so I was not dressed for the weather. It was windy and cold, and several women with buggies and babies were waiting as well in the cold, damp and windy weather. \n\nI just need to debrief as I didn’t realise Ryanair was actually THAT bad till I experienced it today. Is it usual for all the flights to be delayed and having your obviously okay baggage questioned? Is Dublin airport always that strict?",

    "title": "What Airlines Are Not on Expedia: Discover Alternative Travel Options",
    "text": "This article will delve into a specific facet of online travel booking that often leaves travelers scratching their heads: the airlines that *aren't* listed on those popular third-party sites like Expedia. We're diving deep to understand why some carriers choose to bypass these digital behemoths and where you can actually find their fares. It's more than just a simple list – it's about understanding the intricate dance between airlines and travel agencies, the dynamics of direct booking versus aggregator platforms, and ultimately, how *you* can uncover the best deals and flight options by knowing where to look. Get ready to become a savvier traveler, armed with the knowledge to navigate the sometimes-confusing world of online flight searches. Let's unravel the mystery of what airlines are not on Expedia and why.\n\nThe Elusive Airlines: Why Some Fly Solo, Away from Expedia's Embrace\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEver felt like you're missing out on certain flight options when scrolling through Expedia? You're not imagining things! While Expedia and its ilk are fantastic tools, they don't have a complete monopoly on airfare listings. There's a whole contingent of airlines that prefer to play by their own rules, opting out of these massive online travel agencies (OTAs). This isn't some random decision, though. There are strategic reasons behind this \"go-it-alone\" approach, and understanding them is key to figuring out where to find those potentially hidden gems of flights. Think of it like shopping for a unique item – you wouldn't find everything in a giant department store, right? Sometimes, you need to go directly to the source, and the same applies to certain airlines.\n\n### The \"Why\" Behind the Absence: Unpacking the Reasons\n\nSo, why do these airlines choose to be the wallflowers of the online travel world? It's not a single, simple answer. There's a complex interplay of business strategies, cost considerations, and a desire for greater control. Let's break down some of the key factors at play:\n\n- **Direct Booking is King (for Them):** Many airlines, especially the larger, established carriers, are heavily invested in driving traffic and bookings to their own websites. They see it as the most profitable channel. When you book directly, they don't have to pay a commission or fee to the OTA. Think of it as cutting out the middleman. This direct relationship also allows them to control the entire customer journey, from booking to post-flight service, which can be beneficial for building brand loyalty and offering personalized experiences.\n- **Controlling Their Brand and Customer Experience:** Airlines spend a fortune cultivating their brand image and crafting a specific customer experience. They worry that listing on a generic platform like Expedia can dilute their brand a bit. They want you to associate your flight experience directly with *them*, not a third-party site. Furthermore, booking directly allows them to handle customer service directly, which they might prefer, believing they can offer better or more consistent support than an OTA.\n- **Cost Savings are a Big Deal:** As mentioned before, OTAs charge commissions. These can be significant and eat into an airline's profit margins. By not listing on these platforms, airlines can potentially pass some of those savings on to the customer in the form of lower fares, or simply keep more of the revenue for themselves. Every penny counts in the highly competitive airline industry.\n- **Focus on Niche Markets and Routes:** Some airlines specialize in specific routes or operate primarily in particular regions. They might find less value in being on a global platform like Expedia if the majority of their target audience isn't typically using these sites for their specific needs. They might rely more on local marketing and direct sales.\n- **Legacy Systems and Technical Hurdles:** Believe it or not, integrating with massive platforms like Expedia isn't always a walk in the park. Some airlines, particularly smaller or older ones, might have legacy booking systems that are difficult or expensive to connect with these modern OTAs. It’s not always a strategic choice; sometimes, it's a technical limitation.\n\nThese are just some of the driving forces behind an airline's decision to go rogue from the major OTAs. It's a strategic calculation based on their business model, target market, and operational capabilities.\n\nThis next section dives into the heart of the matter – providing you with actionable information. We've explored *why* some airlines aren't on Expedia, and now we're going to tell you *which* ones are often missing from this popular platform. Knowing this is the first step to expanding your flight search horizons and potentially snagging a better deal or a more convenient route. Get ready to add some new names to your travel vocabulary!\n\n### The Usual Suspects: Airlines You Won't Typically Find on Expedia\n\nAlright, let's get down to brass tacks. While the landscape can change, and some brief partnerships might occur, there's a pretty consistent list of airlines you'll likely *not* find readily available for booking on Expedia. It's important to remember that this isn't an exhaustive, unchanging encyclopedia, but these are the airlines that generally prioritize direct bookings and their own distribution channels. Knowing these names is crucial for a truly comprehensive flight search.\n\n- **Some of the Ultra-Low-Cost Carriers (ULCCs):** This is a big one. Many ULCCs, both in the US and internationally, have built their business model around direct sales and stripping away any extra costs, including OTA commissions. Airlines like:\n    \n    \n    - **Spirit Airlines:** A major player in the US ULCC scene, Spirit is notorious for its low base fares and extensive fees. You'll almost always find their best (and sometimes only) prices on their own website.\n    - **Frontier Airlines:** Similar to Spirit, Frontier is another US-based ULCC that heavily pushes direct bookings.\n    - **Ryanair:** A giant in the European ULCC market, Ryanair is famous for its incredibly low fares and direct-to-consumer approach. You won't find their flights on most major OTAs.\n    - **Wizz Air:** Another prominent European ULCC, Wizz Air also focuses on direct sales.\n    - And many other regional or less globally recognized ULCCs around the world.\n- **Certain Smaller, Regional Airlines:** Airlines that primarily serve smaller markets or specific routes might also choose to bypass major OTAs. Their customer base might be more localized, and they might not see the value in the global reach of platforms like Expedia.\n- **Some Luxury or Boutique Airlines:** Airlines that cater to a very specific, high-end market might prefer to manage their bookings directly to maintain a personalized touch and control the entire customer experience from start to finish.\n- **A Few National Flag Carriers (in specific instances):** While many national flag carriers *do* list on OTAs, there can be exceptions, especially for specific routes or during certain promotional periods. It's always worth checking their direct website even if you see them listed elsewhere.\n\nIt's important to note that even if an airline isn't typically on Expedia, they might still partner with other, perhaps smaller or more specialized, travel agencies. But for the big hitters like Expedia, Priceline, and the like, the airlines listed above are often absent friends.\n\nThis next section tackles a critically important question: \"Okay, I know *which* airlines are not on Expedia, but where on earth do I find their flights?\" This is where your savvy traveler skills come into play. While it might require a little more effort than a one-stop-shop search on an OTA, knowing where to look for these \"missing\" airlines can open up a whole new world of possibilities, potentially saving you money or providing you with more convenient flight times.\n\n### The Hunt is On: Where to Find Those Elusive Fares\n\nSo, if you can't just type in your destination on Expedia and expect to see every single flight option, where *do* you go? The answer is multifaceted, and becoming a successful flight hunter means knowing which tools to use for which job. Think of it like having a toolbox – different screws require different screwdrivers! Here's where you should be looking to uncover those flights from airlines that are not on Expedia:\n\n- **The Airline's Official Website:** This is your absolute number one resource. If you suspect an airline flies a route you're interested in, go directly to their website. This is where you will find their most up-to-date schedules, fares, and potentially exclusive deals or loyalty program benefits. Remember, airlines *want* you to book directly; they often make it easy and sometimes even incentivize it.\n- **Google Flights:** This is an invaluable tool that scrapes data from various sources, including many airlines directly. While it might not always show *every single* flight from every single airline (especially the super niche ones), it's significantly better than many traditional OTAs for showing a broader range of options, including those from some ULCCs. It's also fantastic for exploring different dates and destinations with its calendar and map features. Think of it as a powerful aggregator, but with a wider net than Expedia for certain carriers.\n- **Skiplagged:** This website specifically highlights \"hidden city\" ticketing opportunities (though be aware of the potential risks and airline policies surrounding this practice). However, it also often includes flights from airlines that don't appear on mainstream OTAs, particularly ULCCs, as it pulls data from various sources. Use with caution and research the implications of hidden city ticketing thoroughly!\n- **Kayak:** While Kayak is also an aggregator, it sometimes pulls in data from different sources than Expedia and can occasionally show flights from airlines that you might not find elsewhere on OTAs. It's worth including in your search arsenal as a comparison tool.\n- **Momondo:** Similar to Kayak, Momondo is another strong flight search engine that aggregates deals from various providers. It's known for its visually appealing interface and can sometimes unearth interesting combinations or airlines not shown on other platforms.\n- **Airline-Specific Apps and Email Lists:** If you frequently fly a particular airline, especially one that's not always on OTAs, download their app and sign up for their email list. This is where they'll announce sales, promotions, and new routes first.\n\nBy using a combination of these resources, you'll significantly increase your chances of finding the flights you're looking for, even those from airlines that deliberately avoid the Expedia ecosystem.\n\nFinding flights from airlines not listed on Expedia might seem like a hurdle, but it presents a unique opportunity to dig a little deeper and potentially unearth some fantastic deals or more convenient travel options. This next section focuses on empowering you with the knowledge and strategies to navigate this landscape effectively. It’s about becoming a more informed and efficient traveler in the digital age.\n\n### Becoming an Expert Flight Finder: Strategies for Success\n\nNow that you know *why* some airlines avoid Expedia and *where* to generally look for their flights, let's talk about honing your skills as a flight finder. It’s not just about plugging in dates and hoping for the best; it’s about having a strategy and knowing how to leverage the tools available to you. Think of it like being a detective, piecing together clues to find the perfect travel solution.\n\n- **Be Flexible (If You Can):** This is arguably the biggest game-changer. Being flexible with your travel dates, times, and even your departure or arrival airport can dramatically impact the prices you find and the airlines available to you. Airlines that aren't on Expedia, particularly ULCCs, often have the most attractive fares on less popular travel days and times. Using flexible search tools like Google Flights' calendar view is invaluable here.\n- **Search Directly First:** Before you even *think* about an OTA, if you have a specific airline in mind (perhaps one known for its low fares on a certain route, even if it's not on Expedia), go to their website first. You might be surprised at the direct-booking deals you find.\n- **Utilize Aggregators Beyond the Usual Suspects:** As mentioned earlier, explore Google Flights, Kayak, and Momondo. These platforms often pull in data from a wider range of airlines, including some that bypass Expedia. Don't rely solely on one search engine.\n- **Compare Apples to Apples (and Oranges to Oranges):** When comparing prices from different sources, be absolutely sure you're comparing the total cost. Those super-low fares from ULCCs not on Expedia often don't include baggage fees, seat selection fees, or even carry-on bag fees. Add all those potential extras in to get a true comparison. A seemingly cheaper flight on a ULCC's website might end up being *more* expensive than a slightly higher base fare on a full-service carrier listed on Expedia once all the fees are factored in.\n- **Consider the Convenience Factor:** While finding the cheapest fare is often the goal, sometimes convenience is king. A direct flight on an airline not on Expedia might be worth a little extra compared to a multi-stop journey on an airline you found on an OTA. Factor in travel time, layovers, and airport convenience.\n- **Don't Be Afraid to Mix and Match:** Sometimes the best itinerary involves booking separate one-way tickets on different airlines, potentially even combining a flight on an airline not on Expedia with one you found there. This can be a little more work and comes with potential risks if one leg of your journey is delayed or cancelled, but it can also unlock some real savings or better timing.\n- **Sign Up for Airline Newsletters and Follow Them on Social Media:** Airlines, especially ULCCs, frequently announce sales and promotions through these channels *before* or *instead of* listing them on OTAs. Being in the loop can give you a heads-up on great deals.\n- **Clear Your Cookies and Use Incognito Mode:** While airlines and booking sites deny it influences pricing, many travelers swear by clearing their browser cookies or using incognito mode when searching for flights. It's a simple step that can't hurt!\n\nBy adopting these strategies, you’ll become a more empowered and effective flight searcher, capable of navigating the complex world of online booking and uncovering opportunities you might otherwise miss.\n\n\"Save up to 90% on flights with these amazing deals: https://educdunet.com/\"\n\nWe've explored the \"why\" and the \"where,\" and now we're going to delve into a crucial aspect of booking with airlines that are less visible on mainstream OTAs: understanding the nuances and potential trade-offs. It's not always a straightforward \"cheaper is better\" scenario. Knowing what to expect and what to look out for is essential for a smooth travel experience, especially when dealing with airlines that operate differently. Get ready to learn about the fine print and the realities of flying with carriers that prioritize direct bookings.\n\n### Navigating the Nuances: What to Expect When Booking Directly (and Exclusively)\n\nBooking directly with an airline, especially one that deliberately avoids major OTAs like Expedia, comes with its own set of considerations. It's usually a deliberate choice by the consumer aiming for a potentially lower price or a specific route, but it's important to be aware of the potential differences in the booking experience and the implications for your trip.\n\n- **Airline-Specific Terms and Conditions:** When you book directly, you are subject solely to that airline's terms and conditions of carriage. These can differ significantly from airline to airline and may have different policies regarding cancellations, changes, baggage, and denied boarding compared to what you might be accustomed to when booking through a larger OTA (which might have its own layer of booking terms). Always read the fine print!\n- **Customer Service Direct from the Source:** If something goes wrong – a flight delay, cancellation, or a baggage issue – you'll be dealing directly with the airline's customer service department. This can be a good thing, as they are the ultimate authority on their operations. However, the quality and responsiveness of airline customer service can vary *greatly*. Be prepared to potentially spend time on hold or navigating automated systems.\n- **Add-on Fees are Par for the Course (Especially with ULCCs):** As we touched on earlier, those incredibly low base fares offered by airlines not on Expedia, particularly ULCCs, often come with a long list of potential add-on fees. These can include fees for:\n    \n    \n    - Checked baggage\n    - Carry-on baggage (yes, even for what you might consider a standard carry-on!)\n    - Seat selection (even choosing a basic seat)\n    - Printing your boarding pass at the airport\n    - Food and drinks onboard\n    - Priority boarding\n    - Changes or cancellations\n    \n    It's absolutely imperative to factor in all these potential fees when comparing the total cost of your ticket. What seems cheap upfront might not be the case in the end.\n- **Less Centralized Information:** When you book multiple legs of a journey on different airlines through a major OTA, the OTA often acts as a central point of contact for all your flight information. When you book directly with separate airlines, you'll need to manage each booking individually. This means keeping track of multiple confirmation numbers, checking in separately, and being responsible for coordinating connections if you've booked separate tickets.\n- **Lack of a Third-Party Advocate:** If you have a dispute with an airline, booking through a major OTA can sometimes provide an extra layer of support or advocacy. While not always guaranteed, the OTA might intervene on your behalf in certain situations. When you book directly, you're on your own in dealing with the airline.\n- **Potential for Less Convenient Booking Interfaces:** While many airlines have excellent websites and apps, some smaller carriers or those with older systems might have less user-friendly booking platforms compared to the polished interfaces of major OTAs.\n\nNone of these are necessarily reasons *not* to book with an airline simply because they aren't on Expedia, but they are important factors to be aware of so you can go into the process with your eyes wide open. Forewarned is forearmed!\n\nThis next section expands our view beyond just the major airlines. The world of air travel is vast and includes numerous smaller players, regional carriers, and even specialized charter services. Understanding how these different types of airlines operate and where to find their listings is crucial for anyone looking to explore every possible travel option, especially for less common routes or destinations.\n\n### Beyond the Big Guys: Regional, Charter, and Other Not-So-Expedia Airlines\n\nWhile the major international and domestic carriers get most of the attention, a significant portion of air travel is handled by smaller, more specialized airlines. These are often the airlines that are less likely to have a major presence on global platforms like Expedia. Knowing how to find information and book with these carriers is key for accessing niche routes or specific types of air travel.\n\n- **Regional Airlines:** These airlines typically operate shorter flights within a specific geographical region, often feeding passengers to larger hubs or connecting smaller cities. They might be branded under a major airline's name (as a \"regional partner\") but are operated by a separate company. Their flights might appear on OTAs when they are part of a larger itinerary booked through a partner airline, but booking directly with the regional carrier for individual flights might not be possible or is less common. Finding their independent routes often requires searching specific regional airport websites or using aggregators that specialize in regional travel.\n- **Charter Airlines:** These airlines don't operate on a fixed schedule like commercial airlines. Instead, they are hired for specific flights, often for tour operators, sports teams, or private groups. You won't find their flights on Expedia because they aren't available for public booking in the traditional sense. If you're interested in charter travel, you'd need to go through a charter broker or a company that specializes in arranging charter flights.\n- **Specialty Airlines:** This category includes airlines that serve very specific purposes, such as cargo airlines, air ambulances, or airlines that operate scenic flights or specialized tours. These are obviously not going to be on a consumer-focused OTA like Expedia.\n- **Membership-Based or Fractional Ownership Programs:** Airlines that operate on a membership or fractional ownership model (like some private jet services) are not available on public booking platforms. You'd need to be a member or owner to access their flights.\n\nThe key takeaway here is that the world of air travel extends far beyond the airlines you see on Expedia. If you're looking for a specific, less common route or a particular type of air service, you might need to broaden your search beyond the usual OTAs and look into the operations of regional, charter, or specialty carriers that might not have a public listing on those platforms. It's about understanding the different facets of the airline industry.\n\nThis next section is a direct response to the title's core question. We've covered the *why* and the *where*, and now we're explicitly listing some of the most common airlines you'll find absent from Expedia. This serves as a quick reference guide for travelers who are specifically looking for flights on these carriers and are wondering why they aren't showing up in their usual searches.\n\nWhat Airlines Are Not on Expedia? A Quick Reference Guide\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor those of you who just want the straight scoop, here’s a list of some of the major airlines that are frequently *not* listed on Expedia. Remember, the online travel landscape is fluid, and occasional partnerships or temporary listings might occur, but these carriers generally prioritize direct bookings and their own distribution channels. If you're looking for flights on these airlines, head directly to their websites or use alternative search tools as discussed earlier. This isn't an exhaustive list of every single airline in the world that isn't on Expedia, but it covers many of the most prominent ones that travelers often look for.\n\n- **Spirit Airlines:** A major US-based ultra-low-cost carrier.\n- **Frontier Airlines:** Another prominent US ultra-low-cost carrier.\n- **Ryanair:** A massive European ultra-low-cost carrier.\n- **Wizz Air:** A significant European ultra-low-cost carrier.\n- **Allegiant Air:** A US-based ultra-low-cost carrier focusing on leisure travel to smaller cities.\n- **Certain smaller, regional airlines operating independently (not as a partner to a major carrier):** It's difficult to list all of these as they are numerous and often operate locally. If you're searching for flights to or from a smaller airport, investigate the airlines that serve that specific location directly.\n\nThis list provides a starting point for your flight searches, helping you avoid frustration when these airlines don't appear on Expedia.\n\nNow that we've covered which airlines are typically absent from Expedia, let's consider the practical implications for you, the traveler. How does this knowledge actually help you plan your trips more effectively? This section focuses on leveraging the information we've discussed to become a savvier and more efficient traveler, ensuring you find the best options for your needs, even if it means looking beyond the most popular online travel agency.\n\n### Leveraging the Knowledge: How Knowing \"What Airlines Are Not on Expedia\" Helps You\n\nUnderstanding which airlines aren't on Expedia isn't just some trivial piece of information; it's a powerful tool in your travel planning arsenal. This knowledge can directly impact the flights you find, the prices you pay, and ultimately, the success of your trip. Here's how knowing \"what airlines are not on Expedia\" can give you an edge:\n\n- **Finding Cheaper Fares:** As we’ve discussed, airlines that prioritize direct bookings, particularly ULCCs, often offer their lowest fares exclusively on their own websites. By knowing which airlines are in this category, you can bypass Expedia and go straight to the source, potentially saving a significant amount of money, especially on short-haul flights or when you can travel light.\n- **Accessing More Flight Options:** For certain routes, especially those served by regional airlines or less globally known carriers, knowing where to look outside of Expedia can reveal flight options you wouldn't otherwise see. This can be crucial for reaching smaller airports or finding more convenient schedules.\n- **Avoiding Frustration During Your Search:** Imagine searching for hours on Expedia for a flight you suspect exists, only to find nothing. Knowing that certain airlines don't list there can save you time and frustration. You can quickly pivot to a direct search on the airline's website or an alternative aggregator.\n- **Potentially Finding Direct Routes on ULCCs:** Sometimes, a ULCC not on Expedia might offer a direct flight on a route where other carriers listed on Expedia only offer connecting flights. If a direct flight is a priority for you, knowing which ULCCs fly that route and checking their websites directly is essential.\n- **Better Understanding the Total Cost of Travel:** Knowing that airlines not on Expedia often have a hefty list of ancillaries forces you to consider the total cost of your trip upfront. This proactive approach helps you budget accurately and avoid unpleasant surprises at the airport.\n- **Empowering Your Travel Decisions:** Ultimately, being aware of the airlines that operate outside the Expedia sphere gives you more control over your travel planning. You’re not limited by the offerings of a single platform; you have the knowledge to cast a wider net and find the best fit for your specific travel needs and budget.\n\nIn essence, this knowledge transforms you from a passive consumer relying on a single platform to an active participant in the flight search process, armed with the information to uncover hidden gems and potentially better deals.\n\nThis final section before the conclusion provides a summary of the key takeaways from our exploration of airlines that aren't on Expedia. It serves as a quick recap of the most important points to remember as you embark on your flight searches, empowering you to make informed decisions and find the best travel solutions for your next adventure.\n\n### Summing It Up: Key Takeaways for Savvy Travelers\n\nWe've covered a lot of ground exploring the world of airlines that are not on Expedia. Here's a quick recap of the most important things to keep in mind as you plan your next trip:\n\n1. **Expedia doesn't have every airline:** Don't assume that a search on Expedia will show you every single flight option available. Many airlines, particularly ULCCs and some regional carriers, prioritize direct bookings.\n2. **Know the \"usual suspects\":** Be aware of airlines like Spirit, Frontier, Ryanair, and Wizz Air, which are frequently absent from major OTAs.\n3. **Head directly to the airline's website:** This is your primary resource for finding flights on airlines that aren't on Expedia.\n4. **Utilize alternative search tools:** Google Flights, Kayak, and Momondo can often show a wider range of airlines compared to traditional OTAs.\n5. **Factor in the total cost:** When comparing fares from airlines not on Expedia, especially ULCCs, always add up all potential fees (baggage, seat selection, etc.) to get a true comparison.\n6. **Be flexible with your travel dates and times:** This is key to finding the best deals, especially on airlines that prioritize direct bookings.\n7. **Understand the nuances of direct booking:** Be prepared to deal directly with the airline for customer service and understand their specific terms and conditions.\n8. **Consider regional and specialty carriers for less common routes:** If you're looking for flights to smaller airports or for specific purposes, you might need to look beyond the typical airlines and platforms.\n9. **Knowing which airlines are not on Expedia empowers your travel planning:** This knowledge allows you to broaden your search, potentially find cheaper fares, access more options, and make more informed travel decisions.\n\nBy keeping these points in mind, you'll be well-equipped to navigate the complexities of the online travel world and find the best flight options for your needs, even if they aren't listed on every single platform. Happy travels!\n\n\"Save up to 90% on flights with these amazing deals: https://educdunet.com/\"\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nSo there you have it! Delving into the world of what airlines are not on Expedia reveals a fascinating layer to online travel booking. It's clear that while platforms like Expedia offer incredible convenience, they don't provide a complete picture of the airline landscape. By understanding why some carriers – particularly ultra-low-cost and certain regional airlines – choose to operate outside these major OTAs, and more importantly, by knowing *where* to find their flights (hint: usually their own websites and alternative aggregators!), you become a much more savvy and resourceful traveler.\n\nThis knowledge isn't just academic; it has tangible benefits. It can lead you to cheaper fares, unlock access to more convenient routes, and save you time and frustration during your planning process. Remember to always consider the total cost of your ticket, including all those potential add-on fees, and be prepared to interact directly with the airline for any customer service needs.\n\nIn a world where information is key, knowing the ins and outs of flight distribution gives you a distinct advantage. So, the next time you're planning a trip, think beyond the usual suspects on Expedia. Explore, compare, and leverage your newfound knowledge to find the perfect flight for your journey. Happy hunting, and even happier travels!",

    "title": "Partidul SOS a solicitat procedură de urgență pentru o propunere legislativă care contrazice legislația UE ce urmează să fie adoptată",
    "text": "Pe 4 iunie, senatorii SOS [au depus o propunere legislativă](https://www.senat.ro/legis/lista.aspx?nr_cls=b214&an_cls=2025) (și au solicitat procedură de urgență) pentru a obliga companiile aeriene să standardizeze dimensiunea bagajului inclus în prețul de bază al biletului la 55x40x20 cm. Asta ar însemna un troler în compartimentul overhead pentru fiecare pasager. Propunerea a fost larg relatată și în presa.\n\nPe 5 iunie a avut loc [reuniunea Consiliului pentru Transporturi, Telecomunicații și Energie al Consiliului Uniunii Europene](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/tte/2025/06/05/). Aceasta este, de fapt, o întâlnire între miniștrii transporturilor din toate statele membre. În această ședință s-au luat decizii legate de revizuirea drepturilor pasagerilor aerieni, inclusiv clarificarea situației privind bagajul de mână inclus în biletul standard.\n\nPotrivit [regulamentului revizuit](https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-9795-2025-ADD-1/en/pdf), pasagerii au voie să aducă un obiect personal de 40x30x15 cm (sau care să încapă sub scaunul din față), fără costuri suplimentare – exact ca în situația actuală la Wizz și Ryanair.\n\n# De ce era nevoie de această clarificare?\n\nÎn [decizia C-487/12](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:62012CJ0487) Curtea Europeană de Justiție a stabilit că:\n\n>bagajele de mână \\[...\\] trebuie considerate în principiu ca fiind un element indispensabil al transportului pasagerilor și că, în consecință, transportul acestora nu poate face obiectul unui supliment de preț, cu condiția ca astfel de bagaje de mână să răspundă unor cerințe rezonabile sub aspectul greutății și al dimensiunilor și să respecte cerințele aplicabile în materie de securitate.\n\nTotuși, curtea nu a specificat ce înseamnă \"cerințe rezonabile\". Astfel unele state membre au început să amendeze companiile aeriene low-cost care au perceput taxe suplimentare pentru carry-on de 55x40x20 cm (care nu încap sub scaunul din față). Problema este că în majoritatea avioanelor din Europa, în compartimentul overhead există loc suficient doar pentru ca [aproximativ 60% dintre pasageri să aducă un troler de 55x40x20 cm](https://services.boeing.com/maintenance-engineering/modifications/interiors/737-space-bins). Prin urmare, este imposibil ca toți pasagerii să poată aduce un troler. De aceea a fost necesară o clarificare la nivel european privind bagajele de mână incluse în prețul de bază.\n\n# Legat de propunerea SOS\n\nPropunerea SOS citează exact aceeași decizie a Curții, dar ajunge la o concluzie complet opusă. Așadar, când noile regulamente vor fi adoptate de Parlamentul European, România, ca stat membru, va trebui să le transpună în legislație, iar propunerea SOS va trebui respinsă.\n\nNu știu care era motivul partidului SOS pentru a propune **o lege care este fizic imposibil de aplicat și oricum va trebui respinsă în câteva luni**.

      "Buy a 10kg check-in bag and then you've got coverage for the extra weight. You then go to check-in with your 24kg suitcase which is within the total of 30 kg limit that you've purchased. And yes this is ok to do as Ryanair FAQ states:-\n\n\"For safety reasons, Ryanair does not accept any individual items exceeding 32 kilos or with combined dimensions of more than 80cms (height), 120cms (width) and 120cms (depth).\"\n\n\"Yes. Bag pooling is allowed between passengers with check-in bags on the same flight reservation. This means that if you have 2 20kg Check-in Bags (40kg total) on your booking, one of those bags could weigh 15kg while the other weighs 25kg. However, no bag can weigh more than 32kg.\"\n\nI realise you're only one passenger but the same principle applies.\n\nI've done this myself, in the past, and it was fine.\n\nOf course there is the alternative of leaving your booking as it is and rolling the dice on whether you get caught at check-in with overweight (I suspect you will and that means you'll likely pay double the amount compared to buying an extra 10kg).\n\nGood luck"

The “SIM Card Shield”\n\n\\*\"Bought a ‘tourist SIM’ in Istanbul for $50… only to find locals pay $10. Now I walk 10 mins away from airports to buy from carrier stores (look for ‘Turkcell/Vodafone’ logos).\"\\*\n\n* **Best SIM deals**:\n   * Mexico: Telcel ($10/2GB)\n   * Thailand: AIS ($5/15GB)\n   * Japan: Sakura Mobile ($20/unlimited)\n\n# 5.

    "text": "Hi, will be flying Ryanair the first time, from STN to VIE. Also first time flying within Europe. Non-EU citizens. Will be traveling with teenagers. Completed the online check-in and passport verification, have the boarding pass printed and on the phone. We have 1 luggage to check in (which I have already paid for). Carryon bags are well within the size/weight limit.\n\nSo my question is how early should we arrive at the airport (STN)? The flight is on a Friday 5pm. Thanks so much for your advice!\n\nEdit: sorry I had typo. Flight is Friday 5pm, not Sat, if that makes a difference. ",

      "2 hours is usually recommended and I even do that with hand luggage only.\n\nIn fact, if you’re travelling on public transport, if even suggest aiming for earlier than that. Possibly some time between 2-3pm. You just never know and I would always lean towards caution.\n\nUltimately though, Ryanair is no different to any other short-haul carrier in terms of check in/security times.",
      "2 hours at least. It's not dependent on Ryanair, it's dependent on getting through airport security. \n\nIf you do get through quickly and have some time to kill, the Wetherspoons (\"the Windmill\") at the far end of the departure lounge is surprisingly nice. Go up to the first floor: there's an enormous space there with a great view of the planes. For the price of a drink you have somewhere to sit and relax that's far better than the zoo in the rest of the departure lounge.",
      "You seem to be very well prepared, and since you only have one bag to check your journey through, the airport SHOULD be relatively smooth.\n\nScreens display the check-in desks for your flight.\n\nAfter checking your one bag, all you haven't do is pass through security and go to your gate.\n\nThe gate will be announced on screens in the departure area.\n\nStansted Airport has a total of 93 departure gates, with 66 exclusively used by Ryanair.  For flights departing from gates 1-39, a shuttle service is available, with two stops to reach the various gates in satellite buildings. Gates 40-59 in Satellite 3 are accessible via a pedestrian footway. So this might take some time.\n\nStansted Airport is generally busiest on a Saturday during the early morning and late evening. Specifically, the peak periods are between 6 AM and 9 AM, and again between 5 PM and 10 PM. This is because of the multiple early morning flights and the return of travelers after their trips, though the latter should not affect you.\n\nRyanair bag drop opens 2 hours before the flight, and I always aim to be at the front of the queue.  \n\nSo my advice would be to aim to be at the airport between 2.5 and 3.0 hours before your flight.  You don't mention how you are getting to the airport, but this schedule allows for travel delays.\n\nStanstead Airport itself recommends getting to the airport at least two hours before a short haul and three hours before a long haul flight.\n\nSome may argue that these timings are unnecessary, but in my opinion, it is much better to be early, sit, and relax with a coffee or other refreshment, browse the shops and duty free store (after security) than find that you are delayed either en route to the airport or with a long queue at security. \n\nHope this helps.  Arrive early, dont stress, and enjoy your flight.\n\nhttps://www.stanstedairport.com/help/passenger-guides/first-time-flyers/",
      "Yeah. Try to be 1,5hr before in the terminal. STN airport is efficient and designed to handle the Ryanair concept. But at peak times it can be really busy. \n\n\nLuggage drop off you rarely have to wait longer than 10 min. The self tagging kiosks for checked luggage are a marvel and reduce queues at baggage drop off counter to negligible time. \n\n\nAirport security is very efficient, but I'd put just in case a couple of minutes extra into it as the shear masses can overclock it easy. \n\nPath to the gate after security can be a bit lenghly, too. Through all the shops, the central ’plaza‘ and then, depending on the gate number, either via a footpath with two escalators or via a people mover. Count something like 15 min to the furthest gate if you walk fast. Boarding gates are closing 15-20 min prior to departure time. \n\nHave a good flight.",
      "Thanks all for the suggestion. I just noticed there is ‘fast track’ for the STN security line. Are we talking about fast track like Disneyland lol? Is it something I should consider? Btw just noticed I made a typo. The flight is Friday 5pm, not Sat, if that makes a difference."

No one batted an eye at my bag on the flight back even though it was full. \n\nWith this and overbooking the flights so seats are no longer guaranteed I won't be flying with them anymore. Aer Lingus usually flies to the same cities and functions like a real airline",
      "I had a similar same issue with Aer Lingus 2 weeks ago on an Aer Lingus Regional flight.  I know Aer Lingus Regional has slightly smaller hand baggage requirements then other Aer Lingus flights, so I use a small lightweight Samsonite soft-side backpack which I know meets their size requirements and always fits under the seat, even when full.  I've flown Aer Lingus Regional with this same bag 3-4 times a month for the past few years whilst working on contract. When we went to board the young woman at the desk told me to put it in their bag measurer: it clearly fit, but she argued otherwise, despite other people in the queue behind me backing me up.  She was having none of it, and said unless I paid 35€ she wouldn't let me board.  She then told me to leave the bag with the baggage handler at the foot of the plane steps for it to be put in the hold.  When I went to give the bag to him he said 'Why did they make you pay for this?! It's fine!' and told me to just take it onboard with me (where it easily fitted, as usual, under the seat).  Curiously, I saw plenty of other older people whose bags were clearly larger than mine - including hardshell suitcases - that she didn't question at check-in.  There was a bit of a discussion on the bus transfer to the plane about it, and it seemed the only people made to pay \"excess hand luggage\" charges by her were younger females travelling alone :/ \n\nI've lodged a complaint with Aer Lingus, but no reply yet...  Very disappointed as I'm a frequent flyer, and there isn't exactly much other choice of airline from Dublin.",
      "Howya lads. I posted some of this on a very similar thread on the Ireland sub the other day with some information regarding the actual size of the small (free) bag and so on, but thought it might be useful. Sorry if it runs long.\n\nI think it's pretty clear that Ryanair and some other carriers are trying to find a way for the bag \\*not\\* to fit, based on flyers' feedback on social media recently. It's not a case of people trying to take oversized bags necessaily as people here and on other sites are being stopped with bags they've used many times in the past without a problem.\n\nA woman called Sarah Giblin who is designing a new carryon called a RiutBag measured the top part of the Ryanair cage at the airport recently and these are the results she posted.\n\n1. Height (bottom-to-top of the metal shelf): 300mm.\n2. Width (side-to-side of the shelf): 412mm at narrowest point and 422mm at widest - the sides taper slightly.\n3. Depth (rear-to-front of the shelf): 208mm at narrowest, and 210mm at widest.\n\nSo in terms of actually fitting inside the thing your bag in centimetres would need to be on (or a millimetre under) \\*30cm x 41.2cm x 20.8cm\\*. Over that it won't fit if it's a rigid case. These numbers are slightly more than the stated sizes allowed according to the Ryanair website. I have the measurement of the seat space under the Boeing 737 Ryanair typically uses somewhere, but these are again a good bit larger than these cage dimensions so there is no doubt that any bag that slots in cage, even with a little push, will fit safely on board under the seat.\n\nIt would be useful if people could take photos of any bag they travel with, whether it passes or not. Please post them on here. Ideally include the actual measurements of the bag as the stated sizes on an adidas or Puma holdall, or a case online aren't always accurate.\n\nSomeone on another site measured the metal cage for the checked bag, listed by Ryanair at 20cm x 40cm x 55cm at a bit more: 21.2cm x 41.2cm x 58 cm to be exact.\n\nIt's a few years ago, but these numbers match Sarah Giblin's measurement for depth and width. That last max height number is from a slightly different (open top) cage. In a YouTube video another traveller measures the height at what looks more like 55cm (it's not the clearest image) in the cage design used now.\n\nRyanair have warning tape inside this metal box and if the bag overlaps that now although your bag fits inside they will force you to pay the penalty fee. \n\nA bag bulging out ever so slightly will still fit in the overhead lockers fine but that doesn't matter if the airline are trying to squeeze you for more money and reject it. \n\nIn fact bags up to 60cm long, and a centimetre or two wider or taller will still fit in those lockers on the Boeings Ryanair uses. A few travel bloggers have posted on this with specific brands of bag that are over the cage max dimensions and packed solid and they had no problems, but that was then...\n\nJust a hunch but I wouldn't be amazed if that tape brings the depth (from front to back) to just a millimetre over the measurement stated on their website, but perhaps someone can confirm that by taking a tapemeasure when they are at the airport and letting us know.",

      "This is a prime case of survivorship bias. You don’t hear of the tens of thousands of flights where we are able to identify an area of potential severe turbulence, deviate away from it, and subsequently land without encountering it. You only hear about the few and far-between cases where it was unforecasted and where it caused injuries. Turbulence doesn’t show up on radar, and it’s never predictable enough to know exactly where it’s going to be. This is why we are so adamant that passengers adhere to the seatbelt sign and to wear your seatbelt even when the sign isn’t on. That will all but guarantee that you will never be injured in an airplane.\n\nThe emergency landing was likely due to the injuries, but that information will come out with the preliminary investigation.",
      "I took a flight from London to Nice yesterday. The turbulence was strong — I had to tuck my phone under my T-shirt, tighten my seatbelt, and hold onto the seat in front of me with both hands.

I felt like I was the only one who was worried.",
      "You can’t see turbulence",
      "Turbulence isn't predictable like a weather forecast yet. Pilots rely largely on reports from other pilots. There are some environmental conditions that make it more likely, but it can also happen in clear skies without warning. \n\nMy assumption without knowing the details is that the injured were either flight attendants, passengers walking about, or passengers seated but unbelted. Always wear your seatbelt when seated. \n\nA severe turbulence event with injuries is a good reason to get on the ground and have them treated."

But another Spanish union - Union Sindical Obrera - won a court case in March to nullify the deal.\n\nThe Irish airline has now written to Union Sindical Obrera to say it will be informing its members how much they owe.\n\nUnion Sindical Obrera has hit back at Ryanair's decision to claw back five month's worth of pay rises, but the firm said: \"USO are complaining about pay cuts that result from their court case.\"\n\nIt added: \"Ryanair is complying with the court case that Union Sindical Obrera took to cut pay while it is under appeal.\"”\n\nPretty crazy case of malicious compliance.

      "Its Ryanair for fucksake ,that means your New York destination will be a cornfield in Iowa",
      "A lot of Ryanair hate in this topic, but I genuinely love it. I'm a bare bones traveler anyway, when I first went to England and booked a Ryanair flight people warned me how awful it was going to be, but out of the three or four Ryanair flights I've never run into a problem. Their seats are uncomfortable there are no amenities but so fucking what, if you told me that I could fly back home to see my folks for 40 bucks, I'd let you punch me in the fucking stomach.\n\nRyanair isn't for people who want to be treated nicely, it's for people like me who want to get from point a to point b as cheaply as possible, and are willing to make great sacrifices to do it. My fiance is from England, and if they follow through with this, I guarantee you we'd be visiting her family in England all the time."

However they are obligated to arrange means of transportation to your destination, whether it be on another flight or a bus transfer for example.

      "A lot of different things, the basic premise of low cost is to remove everything that is \"non essential\" (or add it back as a fee)\n\n* So they're only cheap if you stick to the bare minimum: moving from A to B, but they'll slap you with additional fees for everything (carry on bag, seat selection, etc). It would be interesting to see what is the real average ticket price per customer.\n* They use out of the way airports with lower fees\n* They'll cut corners on everything up to the legal limit, like making their pilots fly more hours etc.\n\nEdit: Looked up last Annual Report for Ryanair .\n\nAncillary Revenues (inflight sales, luggage fees, etc) add \\~47% vs Ticket sales.\n\nSo for a 100€ Flight, they on average book 147€ total revenues.\n\nEdit2: I'm talking from memory, so it might not be true anymore, but they also used to have a \"simpler\" fleet of planes (like leasing a bunch of A320 from Airbus) that made maintenance simpler vs the large companies that have a mix of Boeing, Airbus, long range/short range.",
      "They're basically selling flights a la carte - the seat on the flight is cheap to attract people in, but then they sell a lot of add-ons that typically would be included with a ticket on more traditional airlines. For example, depending on the airline, you may be charged extra to pick a specific seat, have a carryon luggage, buy a drink on the flight, have a paper ticket, etc.\n\nA lot of times, those add-ons end up making the ticket cost as much (or sometimes more) than a traditional airline ticket.",

You’re spending €30 all together, even though the ticket only costs €10. \n\nThen you go to a different cinema and pay €30 flat, with “free” snacks, drinks, and choice of seating. You’re spending the same amount, it’s just calculated differently. \n\nNow, if you go and really don’t spend any extra money - you don’t buy any snacks, you take any seat, and basically don’t care that you’re having a shittier experience - then it *is* cheaper to do it that way. But it’s only cheaper because you’re avoiding paying for stuff that makes the experience easier. \n\n(BTW this is the same thing with Spirit Airlines in the U.S. - if you hear people joke about Spirit Airlines in American media, now you know why)",
      "Ryan Air carries 169million passengers a year, making a profit of €1.3bl. A profit of less than €10 per ticket. \n\nBritish Airways (for example) passenger traffic is 37million, with a profit of £1.16bl. Actually much more profitable, more money fewer flights.  \n\nThe short answer is Ryan Air serves an entire continent, the largest and richest market in the world - the EU and the UK. National airlines serve relatively small European countries, and can’t compete on the sheer amount of flights, but are generally more profitable on a per ticket basis. It’s not really accurate to say that Ryan Air is more profitable - it’s just serving more flights."

My past experiences in hospitality and as a language interpreter (I speak 5 languages) gave me enough confidence to apply.\n\nThe application process took a month, with paperwork, assessments, videos to watch etc.\n\nWhen finally the interview day arrived, I was cut short - simply because my hair wasn't *short* enough.\n\nOne minute in, I wasn't surprised to be asked to show my tattoos. Alongside with the height and weight restrictions, it was stated many times that visible tattoos are not allowed if you want to work for them.\n\nI have a tattoo on my wrist that sometimes can be seen if my sleeves are pulled a little bit. No fuzz about it. \"That's totally fine\", the interviewer said.\n\nNext question caught me off guard completely: \"Are you happy to cut your hair?\"\n\nI didn't even know why this was being asked. I never read about this before.\n\n\"Erm...I wouldn't be happy to cut it at the moment, is it mandatory?\"\n\n\"Yes. Unfortunately we won't be able to proceed as all of our male members have short hair. Consider applying in the future if you change your mind.\"\n\nThe interviewer failed me and closed the call.\n\nNow, I don't have crazy hair. It's not a punk mohawk, not a tiger king mullet, not a pink disco afro. (And even if it was???) It was in a discreet bun hidden behind my neck during the interview.\n\nI wasn't asked to keep it tied - **I was asked to cut it**. What on earth is this, the military? I understand tattoos can give a bad image to *some* people...but what about long hair? What if it had to do with my religion? What if it was a woman having short hair instead?\n\nIt puzzles me even more as my long hair was showing in my pictures and it was never objected or stated in written prior to this interview.\n\nI was wondering if there is an organization or some kind of authority who can help me deal with this issue.

But you certainly can and probably should make a general complaint and maybe you’ll get some courtesy voucher or something.",
      "Indeed, no compensation for the delay is due (as it's weather related) however it sounds like they have not met the obligation to provide \"refreshments\" during the delay which would seem to be a breach of EU261 regulations.\n\nFirst complain to Ryanair however I'll be honest, I expect you'll get a more satisfactory result from complaining to a brick wall.\n\nIf their response is unsatisfactory you could report the incident to one of the national authorities in either your departure or arrival countries (assuming both EU or UK countries) who may take it further with Ryanair but you'll be unlikely to receive any financial compensation though.",
      "Last time I flew ryanair, they had only one experienced steward and three trainees (one of which was Ukrainian girl which barely speaks english and all communication with her was in russian). That one guy was yelling at them all the flight, boarding was a mess and took 45 minutes just to get into the plane, and whan landed started teaching them how to open the door. They basically opened door without stairs being pushed outside and had to hold passengers back to not fall out of the plane. In my eyes it is huge safety issue, I can only imagine what may happen during emergency ‼️",
      "In your situation, you have several rights and potential avenues for compensation under EU261 regulations. Here's a breakdown:\n\n### Compensation and Assistance Rights\n\n1. **Flight Diversion and Delay**:\n   - Since your flight from London to Porto was diverted to Madrid due to bad weather, it falls under \"extraordinary circumstances\" which typically exempts the airline from paying standard compensation.\n   - However, you still have rights to care and assistance during the delay. The airline is obligated to provide:\n     - Meals and refreshments proportional to the waiting time.\n     - Free access to communications such as two free phone calls, emails, or faxes.\n     - Accommodation if the delay requires an overnight stay, including transportation between the airport and the accommodation [[❞]](https://help.ryanair.com/hc/en-gb/sections/12488499652753-Delayed-Flight) [[❞]](https://www.kikijourney.com/eu261-compensation-ryanair/).\n\n2. **Basic Amenities**:\n   - Ryanair should have provided you with sufficient water and other essentials during the 4-hour wait on the tarmac. Denying passengers basic necessities like water, especially when needed to prepare food for a baby, could be a breach of their obligations to provide adequate care [[❞]](https://help.ryanair.com/hc/en-us/sections/12488602662545-EU-261-Passenger-Rights) [[❞]](https://www.kikijourney.com/eu261-compensation-ryanair/).\n\n### Steps to Take\n\n1. **Document the Incident**:\n   - Collect all relevant documents, including your boarding passes, any receipts for expenses incurred, and detailed notes on the events (times, interactions with the airline staff, etc.).\n\n2. **Submit a Complaint to Ryanair**:\n   - You can lodge a complaint directly through Ryanair’s official channels. Provide a detailed account of the incident, highlighting the lack of basic amenities and the distress caused.\n\n3. **Escalate if Necessary**:\n   - If Ryanair's response is unsatisfactory, you can escalate your complaint to a national enforcement body or consider using a third-party claims service (though they may take a percentage of any compensation awarded).\n\n### Potential Compensation\n\n- **Compensation for Delay**:\n  While the extraordinary circumstances (bad weather) might exempt Ryanair from paying delay compensation, the failure to provide basic care (like water) can be contested. You can argue that this failure caused undue hardship and distress.\n\n- **Reimbursement for Expenses**:\n  If you incurred any additional expenses due to the delay (like buying water from fellow passengers or extra food), you might be entitled to reimbursement.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIt is definitely worth complaining. Even if the flight diversion due to weather exempts the airline from some compensations, the inadequate care provided can be contested. Document everything thoroughly and pursue the claim through Ryanair's customer service first, escalating if necessary.\n\nFor more details on your rights and how to file a claim, refer to the official Ryanair help page and EU261 guidelines [[❞]](https://help.ryanair.com/hc/en-us/sections/12488602662545-EU-261-Passenger-Rights) [[❞]](https://www.kikijourney.com/eu261-compensation-ryanair/) [[❞]](https://ryanairflightcompensation.com/ryanair-denied-boarding/).\n\nHope this helps, thanks Chat GPT. That's one use case where it can really help"

    "text": "Been mulling this over for a few days now and think I need some outside perspectives. I understand that when you choose to fly with Ryanair that you should expect some shoddy service and I'm fine with that but surely blatant racism is a step to far? \n\nJust back from a 2 week holiday a few days ago to spend the holidays with my girlfriend's family. Had a magical time but unfortunately the whole thing started off on a sour note due to an interaction with a Ryanair employee that I just haven't been able to put to rest in my head.\n\nWhen we were departing from Dublin airport, the employee that was checking my details before boarding the plane was approached by a colleague who made two racist remarks about two separate nationalities right in front of me. \nThe remarks were regarding a German woman she had just dealt with and charged an extra fee for having two bags and an Asian family of 4 she had asked to step out of the line but had yet to deal with. \n\nI spoke up and said ya can't be saying stuff like that and at first she misunderstood and thought that I was I was trying to argue that she shouldn't have charged the German lady for the extra bag but when she realised I was calling her out for racism she asked me to step out of the line so I went and stood beside the asain family. \n\nShe then went about dealing with the family in the most unnecessary and confrontational manner. The father had poor English and she was incredibly condisending towards him and when his wife tried to explain/translate for him the employee would bark at her to step back and say she wasn't talking to her. \n\nI finally realised that she was trying to charge the gentleman for having two suite cases instead if the alloted one suite case and one rucksack but what the family were trying to explain to her was that the father was merely carrying his suitcase AND his wife's suitcase while the wife was carrying both of their rucksacks (and a small child). Because the man had bad English and because she wouldn't let the woman talk they were struggling to get this point across. \nAt this point I stepped in to help them explain and the employee told me to step back and mind my own business and got quite angry but eventually backed down and allowed the family to proceed. \n\nThe employee then turned to me and said that I would have to pay an addional €50 as my rucksack was too large and would have to be stored in the luggage compartment. This was ridiculous, my bag was not too large. It was smaller than my suitcase and smaller than many other peoples carry on luggage so I'm pretty sure she just slapped me with a fine because she didn't like me. She also seemed to just pull the price out of no where as I had heard other people charged €80 for the same thing while I was in the line. \n\nI ultimately paid the fee because A) I was running out of time to board the plane and B) my phone was vibrating nonstop in my pocket which I knew was my girlfriend texting me. She has anxiety so I knew she was freaking out from the worry that I wasn't going to be allowed on the plane so in the end I buckled and paid the charge. \n\nAfter telling family and friends over the holidays I've gotten a mixed bag of responses. I have the unfortunate characteristic that when I see stuff like this I can't leave it alone so many of them were not surprised and said I should have just left it alone. But there's a real divide on wether I should report this to someone. The majority have actually said that I shouldn't bother because it won't fix anything and will only draw more attention on myself and maybe even get myself put on some sort of list when flying (this is from the more conspiratorial family members). Put a few have also said that it's my duty to speak up and \"make a fuss\". \nSo long story short I guess I'm asking wether people think I should go further with this or not and if so who do I even contact? Dublin Airport HR or admin or Ryanair directly?\n\nTLDR: witnessed racism in the airport, confronted racist employee and got slapped with a false luggage fine. How should I proceed?\n\nEDIT -\ngetting a lot of repetitive questions and some horrible DMs over this so I'm gonna settle some details.\n\nLots of DMs asking what my ethnicity is. I am a 27 year old white male from West Cork. I don't see how this is important anyway. \n\nLots of people asking what was the racist comments she said. She quietly said to her colleague who was checking my passport \"F_king typical Germans, wee dictators the lot of them and now I have to deal with these stupid Ch_nks.\"\n\nLots of people are DMing me saying that she wasn't racist, some people are pointing out that the German comment is xenophobic rather than racist. Regardless of which it is it's still discrimination. Please stop nitpicking one word and being pedantic.\n\nYes I measured my bag in the cage yoke. It was a bit of a squeeze but it did fit. Regardless, she wasn't happy and told me it wasn't good enough. I tried to stand my ground but in the end I caved because I was running out of time and my girlfriend was panicking. The main point of my post was not to complain about the luggage charge I was lumped with, I merely included it to show the absolute power trip this woman was on. It was clear that no matter what I did she was determined to screw me over at this point. \n\nSome people are saying I'm being unfair to Ryanair as a whole. I will say all the staff on our flight over and our flight back were a delight but the fact that the company didn't screen her for this sort of carry on when hiring her and haven't caught it since is a bit of a red flag really.\n\nI will be reporting her for her actions and comments to the appropriate authorities that people in the comments have informed me of. I have a email drafted with all the relevant details ready to be sent off in the morning. Thank you all for your help.\n\nLastly, to all the people who said I should have kept my head down and turned a blind eye. I hope ye never find yourselves in a situation where ye could use some help from a stranger, because frankly, ye don't deserve it. ",

    "text": "This happened years ago on a Ryanair flight and is obviously not a big deal, but to this day I wonder if how I acted was okay or assholish.\n\nSo I was sitting in my seat during the flight and got up to pee and change my pad (as - TMI - I was on a heavy day of my period and worried about leakage). I wait in line in front of the lavatory, 2 or 3 people in front of me already waiting as well. After 5-10 minutes it's finally my turn and I move to enter. \n\nJust then a little kid (4-5 years, maybe?) comes running down the aisle, his dad walking a few feet behind him, and kiddo tries to squeeze past my legs into the lavatory as I'm opening the door. I hold my arm out in front of the child and say kindly but firmly \"No, you have to wait in line like I did, it's not your turn.\" Dad says nothing and I move into the stall and close the door. I felt like I was in the right because I had waited in line, I really had to change my pad soon or there'd be blood on my pants, and I thought I was being fair and polite letting the kid know why he had to wait.\n\nSomeone gives a few firm knocks on the door but I just say \"occupied!\" and quickly do my business. As I exit the restroom the dad and child are gone, presumably to use the lavatory in the back of the plane. A male flight attendant, however, is waiting next to the door and in a tone like he has to school an idiot says \"What you did was very rude, that was just a child, what if that was an emergency?\" In an admittedly snippy tone I replied \"What if it was an emergency for me too?\" and went back to my seat.\n\nDoes not letting a child go first automatically make me the asshole, like that flight attendant thought? I would've let kid and dad cut in line if they'd asked, and feel bad because obviously a child can't hold it in like an adult can, but because of the whole trying to squeeze past me approach, my gut reaction was \"no way\".",

She can’t take money so we will have to go to another desk to pay then return and drop the bags off etc. \n\nSo that is a fucking ridiculous price for two small bags, unfortunately we couldn’t just buy a backpack in the airport as the cases were pretty expensive designer gifts from my late grandmother.  \n\nI decided to ignore her and proceed to go through security anyway as I thought the only reason this was mentioned was because I had to check in.\n\nI then read some of Ryanair’s policies and realised this is actually rigorously enforced now and will be 120 euro to check in at the gate with the bags.\n\nI proceed to shit myself, then realise I can actually upgrade my priority on the app for 12 euro to be able to bring larger cabin bags on board. \n\nThis is fantastic and I’m smiling to myself regarding money saved.

I promise to give you guys the time of day in the future with a proper visit,, but it was somewhat squeezed in trip. \n\nAnyway, I've long subscribed to this sub because its an interesting insight into the musings of a country that is very culturally similar, and of course I became fascinated with the popular food stuffs this sub likes to meme, such as the chicken fillet roll.\n\nA coaster enthusiast mate of mine has been bugging me to do the cheap Ryanair thing and pop over to visit Taytomerald Park, and yeah they've gone and opened that Tir Na Egg-nOg precinct, and that new Finna Fail suspended coaster has been getting good reviews, so of course thar makes the place a priority.....and no joke its legitimately one of the worlds best roller coasters, and not only that, it's easy to ride it like 10 times because the staff are sending a train like every minute, so you queue like 15-20 mins max. 10/10 would visit again.\n\nBut of course I gave myself a day for sightseeing/dining, unfortunately for me there was that American college football thing on that weekend, so the city was crawling with seppos walking on the wrong side of the footpath, and not only that, a lot of popular attractions were well and truly booked out, but I still managed to go in and see the book of Kells (presumably that's toooooo cultural), that portal thing, the spire, college green + The adjacent 80s looking shopping centre that's that this sub has an attachment to, halpenny bridge, yada yada wherever my feet would take me.\n\nBut through a bit of planning, I was able to try a few local delicacies.\n\n⚫Chicken Fillet Roll\n\nWent to a Centra.\nOk, I couldn't recall what the overall ideal order is meant to be, I got  spicy, when she asked if I wanted butter or Mayo I said both and she looked at me funny so I quickly corrected and said just butter.\nYeah overall its not bad, I wouldn't so much call it spicy more that it just tastes like a large amount of pepper has been used, the crusty roll is definitely what makes it. \n7/10\n\n⚫ Ham Jambon (not pictured)\nOoooh, almost forgot about these! But the same Centra had these in the warmer.\nMmm these were good. They can be very dangerous, because much like the cheeseburger, it's a quick little hit of grease and umami you can grab on the way.\nThey would be a great way to put on weight. \nNice flaky pastry, cheese was creamy, bits of ham give a little bit of flavour.\n9/10 start exporting.\n\n⚫ Supermacs\nObviously I couldn't gorge myself, so I had a piece of their chicken plus their \"regular burger\" reasoning their basics simple item must be their staple. \nYeah the chicken was fine but not really any better than KFC. The burger was bit leathery and tasted quite processeed, bun was dry, relies a bit on the burger sauce and onion flags too. Cover up those two shortcomings. \n4/10\n\n⚫ Chips and Curry at Emerald Park (not pictured)\nWait so I always under the impression it was just curry sauce on chips, but legit, is it the done thing? You can actuall have a full on chicken curry with veg, served over chips instead of rice? This is revolutionary.\nWorks pretty well, the curry was spicy enough to put to rest any fears of blandness.\n8/10\n\n⚫Leo Burdock fish and chips\nSo when I was walking near Dublin Castle I could see people with what was quite obviously a branded tray of fish and chips, I figured it might have been a tourist trap or something, so I did not investigate further. \nAnyway, fast forward to late the following afternoon, we had a look at Howth because I wanted to see some iconic Irish cliff coastline, and my mate tells me that the place i was describing had a branch in Howth and was actually pretty good.\nObviously not overly commercialise because you still have to wait for them to cook it up fresh which makes it quite nice. Yeah this was excellent, The batter was quite Three-Dimensional really nice and airy, not oily at all. Chips are a bit softer than what I'm accustomed to but still fine, probably only needed half the amount they gave me so you can't really complain about value. \n8/10\n\n⚫Spice Bag\nI did end up walking through Temple Bar later in the evening, and thought I'd just grab a spice bag thing since it would only be small, and you gotta try the \"so bad its good\" utter bastardisation (here in Oz you can get kebab meat served over chips with garlic sauce and chili sauce called a HSP)\nAnyway, I should have predicted from the price, but it's not so much a spice bag rather a spice sack, waaayyyy to much to finish so i fucked off half of it by the time I had reached middle abbey st.\n\nYeah it's decent but holy shit. The salt level is off the charts and it dries your mouth out due to the lack of sauce. Fried chicken was much better than what supermacs had given me, crunchy tender morsels of chicken that would make Conel Sanders weep with joy. The little bits of fried spring onion/shallot really set it off. The stray bits of carrot add crunch.\nI thought it was supposed to come with fried capsicum traditionally but mine didn't so I don't know if I was actually getting a proper one. (Tell me from the photos ?)\nIn the same way that onion goes with sausages, spring onion and chicken work so well. \n7/10\n\n\n⚫ Cadbury Milk\nActual gods nectar, why can't they sell this in Aus??\n10/10\n\n( I bought a couple more bottles and necked them for \"breakfast\" at the airport in lieu of a coffee.)\n\nOverall, an enjoyable place Id like to spend more time exploring, awful summer \"weather\" notwithstanding.\nI know there's a stereotype but shit I wasn't expecting to hear so much random joking and banter everywhere you go, and that was -without- having set foot in a bar.\n\nWhen you go to America, there's always that sense that someone may pull a gun at any moment. \nWhen you go to Ireland, there's a sense that someone may crack a joke at any moment. \n",

I would have responded sooner but I was off traveling to NYC to see a musical (Book of Mormon) and go the the 2024 Nanny Ball with my babe of a wife.\n\nI’m glad so many of you enjoy the little note I left behind a couple decades ago as an optimistic 25 year old about to start making “real money” after getting my 01 Journeyman license. It was not customary for me to leave notes on jobs, but sometimes a little drawing or an encouraging note to the next person in a crawl or confined space (never an F you, it could be difficult enough navigating spaces many people can’t fit into). I loved finding hidden notes from previous generations, especially while working at the old Rainier Brewery when it was sold and then occupied by Tully’s Coffee. Pencilled notes from the 30’s, brushstroke autographs in the old paint shop upstairs, or dirty limericks carved into solid wood walls from the 50s, I certainly thought it would be more than 20 years before someone found a note I left on the back of a junction box cover, but internet stuff would develop and happen and I’d be answering for it to lovers of harmless mysteries, and tradespeople in the PNW who wonder if we’ve crossed paths.\n\nBeing a blue collar electrician, I was jealous of the new people and international travel some of my college bound friends had experienced. Within 18 months of writing this note-on-metal, I took off for hitch hiking in Ireland, buying electroclash records in Berlin, getting hit on Boy George in London, and to leave my work a nighttime voicemail letting them know that 6 weeks traveling wasn’t enough and and I’d be back home in a couple more, and if they didn’t like it oh well. That trip I met and befriended guys in the London-area band Armitage Shanks, and a couple years later was asked, despite not knowing how at the time, to play guitar on their upcoming US tour. So I learned how. World travel became US travel with my pal Stacy in garage-punk-whatever band Pony Time. My Seattle musical career perhaps peaked with the infamous Stallion show with brutal attack on me at the Rock ’n’ Wrestling Rager in 2017, which sent me to the hospital, and the band broke up before we could finish our record deal (for those wondering it was not Sub Pop, they were too small). Only a few rare copies of the double-cassingle are out there, don’t even look to buy  one unless you have real folding money.\n\nI travel now still, but not as hard as I did before. I don’t hitch hike to Canada anymore or sleep outside if I don’t have a place to stay, I guess I travel less dangerously. These days, I probably would get all the suggested shots and anti-malaria stuff before going back to India again instead of just saying forget about it like I did in my 20s. The part of traveling I used to do more was the “show up and figure it out maybe without a place to stay, no map, and take if from there.” That kind of travel is almost obsolete what with computers in phones, but it was exciting and thrilling at times being chased by muggers outside Battersea, or stopping a break in at a hostel, getting free classical music performances at churches in the day and clubbing at night in Europe. \n\nIn 2002 I also set a little time project in motion, inspired by the band Negativland. They had made albums as part of their high school senior project, all with hand made covers, and 15-20 years later is was worth money. So I made a record with a 4 track tape, not knowing how to play any instruments, and released it by mailing 3-5 copies to select dance record stores around the country, and a few around town. I sold exactly one copy at the time of its release, and never collected any consignment. Tube Alloy: The Detection of Sub-Atomic Particles started to get interest from underground dance and lofi people, and 12 years after its release I was shipping cases of the record to Canada and Germany for distribution.\n\nI’m rambling here, but I just wanted to share some details of what I was cooking with at the time, where travel led me, what it brought me, and the trajectory it set me on. It’s not been easy but it’s led to a more fulfilling life, better understanding, and a way to connect with people when I may have so many other difficulties connecting. It’s also easier when you’re younger, at 26 I was way more willing to sleep on the floor under a dining table because that was the only spot available.\n\nFor by IBEW brothers, hello! I’m no longer a member, I’ve given up construction in 2022. I was in Local 76 last, but started in 46 before getting booted out in my 2nd year, which is why you may not find me on a list there. In my 2nd year I had drawn some cartoons of my foreman, which I thought was somewhat justified considering he used some racialist and homophobic language. The cartoons were so funny and rude that some management got ahold of them and they got faxed around the company’s job sites all over Washington, and yeah that kind of thing will get you fired and banned from some certain Seattle-area apprenticeships around 1999/2000, before they made foremen take mandatory classes on how to not call people [REDACTED]. \n\nI hope it’s been a mildly interesting read for you, it’s been fun for me dipping down the road of rocky memories, and thinking back on my rush to see some of the world before it was all catalogued and digitized by someone else. I still want to travel to former eastern-bloc countries and see some of the brutalist and modern USSR architecture before it disappears or becomes inaccessible. I miss a lot of my Seattle friends, but maybe I’ll see you around when I’m not living in the hills of North Carolina.\n\n**OOP COMMENTS**\n\n**thetiredbrushwagg**\n\n> Did you carry a fridge when you were hitchhiking around Ireland?\n\n**OOP**\n\n>> A friend lent me that book a few months before I went and I ended up taking two banjos because of it, it seemed easy enough and for the most part it was. I intended to seek seclusion at the northern tip of Ireland, and got bored after a couple weeks, it was cold on the farmhouse with a coal fireplace for heat. I flew to Germany. I’d buy those Ryanair 1€ flight in advance of where I may have ended up just in case and missed all but a couple. The rest of Europe is not easy to get around with banjos, they don’t care like Irish tended to.\n\n**~**\n\n**Specialist-Stress310**\n\n> As much as I want to believe everything in here - OP's username does NOT check out.

    "text": "On the 30th December I found myself on a ryanair flight to the UK from a european country. We were the last flight of the day departing that airport and also nearly 1h late. At the gate we had 2 agents and a supervisor.\n\nFor those who don’t know ryanair it’s a low cost airline where the basic price gets you a seat and a small bag that needs to fit under the seat in front of you. Anything else costs extra, including priority boarding (you get a 2nd bag and board before everyone else so you can use the over head lockers). And the rules get enforced fairly strictly.\n\nSo they run 2 queues, a priority one and a normal one, which tends to be packed before the gate even opens for folks who need extra storage space. I travel light and tend to only board at the very end so I was able to witness the drama.\n\nOur entitled passenger (EP) was in the priority queue with her boyfriend and his mum. They arrive at the gate, bf and mum scan through, EP’s ticket get rejected. Turns out she hasn’t booked priority and chanced she’d be let through with her partner. The agent tells her that he can’t let her through and she needs to go to the normal queue. She starts arguing with him, the supervisor steps in, says the same and after some back and forth EP goes and stand at the front of the normal queue. The supervisor tells her that she can’t cut the queue and needs to go to the back of the normal queue. She argues some more with the supervisor who stands her ground and EP eventually storms off to the back.\n\nMost people would call it a lesson and just move on. Not EP. She’s ragging. She eventually gets back to the gate (her bf very kindly is waiting for her just after the gate) and decides that she needs to tell the gate agent how unfair this all is and how entitled she was to go priority and/or cut the queue. So she does, raises her voice at the guy scanning her boarding pass and all. Supervisor steps in immediately, takes her aside and tries to have a conversation with her. EP is having none of it, voice is still raised and she’s arguing her case. Her bf has come back and is trying to calm her down and make her stop so they can get on the plane.\n\nNow all the passengers who haven’t boarded yet are watching. The supervisor calmly walks EP to the side of the gate, gets her to step out the barrier then tells her she’s not allowed on board the plane.\n\nIt takes her a second to realise what happened and she starts screaming. But suddenly she’s sorry, she’s now claiming that it’s a misunderstanding because she doesn’t speak English very well, that she didn’t mean it, that she’s very sorry and will calm down if she’s allowed on board and basically repeats that over and over again. Her bf is still trying to get her to calm down. She won’t stop screaming at the supervisor.\n\nSupervisor kinda gives in and tells EP that when boarding is complete she will phone the captain, discuss with him and see if he’ll allow EP on board. That should calm her down, it doesn’t, she’s still yelling, begging and pleading.\n\nI’m now on the tarmac, waiting to get on the plane, and with maybe another 15 passengers, we’re all looking back to see if EP (and bf) will appear through the doors. We’re invested. We board the slowest we’ve ever boarded just to make sure we see what happens next. Will the captain give her a chance the day before new year and let her board? Will he tell her to get lost?\n\nShe appears. She made it. Except she’s now arguing with her bf about it, she still thinks she’s in the right, he’s still trying to make her stop and calm down, he looks like he’s used to her shit and yet tired of it. She gets past my seat still arguing with him. He’s seating next to his mum, EP is elsewhere (you have to pay extra to seat together). Bf and mum are the row in front of my husband, when he seats down he tells his mum “she just wouldn’t drop it, she nearly didn’t get on the plane and she still wouldn’t drop it”.",

      "I live fairly close to one of their hubs so have used a fair bit, and hate them with a passion. Two years ago my wife and I decided to never use them again, after a trip to Gothenburg. First thing was when they changed the flights less than a month before: instead of 8:30am, we’d now fly out at 5:45pm, which effectively would lose us a day out of a weekend trip. It was cheaper for us to have an extra night in the hotel and buy single flights for the previous evening instead. Second thing was the flight back, which was the last flight out on a Sunday. We’re all boarded onto coaches and driven out to our aircraft, which we sit and stare at for fifteen minutes before there’s an apologetic announcement that they’ve located a crew for us who are on their way to the airport.\n\nUnfortunately, we then booked a package trip to Budapest and didn’t realise it was Ryanair flights until it was all sorted. A month after the booking, their new cabin baggage policy was announced, and I wasn’t able to change our booking to priority boarding because we’d agreed to have 10kg bags in the hold at time of booking and it’s one or the other. They’re a fucking joke. I have probably been on 20+ Ryanair flights and cannot recall the last one that took off on time.\n\nEasyJet aren’t flawless, but they’re a luxury compared to Michael O’Leary’s Shower of Shite. ‘Cunt’ is not a strong enough word to describe that man. In March I had a trip to Berlin and made the choice to drive to an airport 40mins further away and pay an extra £15 for the flights with EasyJet because it meant I didn’t have to use Ryanair.\n\nI never get angry or annoyed at their staff, because I know enough of them to know that the staff hate the airline more than the passengers do. They have to pay for their own training and uniforms, they can’t charge phones at work because it’s stealing electricity, they’re encouraged to take pens from other places so that the company don’t have to pay for them. When you go to the airside staff areas, airlines usually provide some tea and coffee making facilities, sandwiches, pastries, and some basic things like that; Ryanair staff have to provide their own.\n\nTl;dr - Ryanair are shit and Michael O’Leary is a bellend",

Your fight against imperialism, peacekeeping and support for the oppressed across the world has had a tremendous impact on my identity. When I studied in Belfast last Spring it was so meaningful to find a little corner of the world which had actually gotten more peaceful over the last 30 years instead of more violent. In every pub, chip shop, Ryanair flight or Sunday dinner I felt a sense of community, kindness and warmth I had never experienced in my 21 years living in America. You have an immense amount to be proud but nothing so great as being a land filled with decent, honest folks trying their best. People in my country are rushing towards a catastrophe for which they cannot comprehend the cost of. Talking with people on both sides of the walls just struck home for me how horrible it is when neighbor fights neighbor and brother fights brother. I know you're probably sick of Yanks getting on here or visiting your island telling you how great it is when they don't have to deal with a housing crisis or the Magdalene Laundries or terrible government coalitions. But just know that the thing which is keeping me going is returning to your shores and starting my life in Ireland, north or south.

      "Actually a useful LPT for those living in Europe.  I was in the Air Force stationed in Germany and used Ryan Air to fly out of Frankfurt-Hahn on the regular.\n\nRoundtrip to London? 15 euros.  Roundtrip to Rome? 25 euro.\n\nIt's not hard to just pack a backpack for a 3-4 day weekend.  I never got hit with any fees.",
      "Buying tickets from the old British Rail using a foreign currency used to be (perhaps it still is) the same. Because of the amount of time it took between accepting foreign money as a payment and the company being able to get it converted at the bank, the price could have fluctuated out of the company's liking. So a 14-day currency sheet was issued to larger stations with rates that took this into account.\n \nIf the actual exchange rate was UK£1 to US$1.60 when an American tourist wanted to buy a ticket using greenbacks, even if it had been within 2% of that for months, the rate was set at $1.80 for £1 just in case the dollar weakened during the period that sheet was in effect (and to cover the bank's charges).\n\nUnderstandable when people are taking hard currency at a ticket window. NOT ACCEPTABLE for an online transaction where the rates are in a computer and can be updated on the fly.",
      "Just fly EasyJet instead - you'll quickly save the premium by flying in to the decent local airport instead of the one two hours away from your destination.",
      "Also, clear your cookies.\n\nRyanair (and some other carriers) use the knowledge that you've searched for the same flights a few times to up the price on the basis that you probably want those flights anyway."

      "\n\nThe UN on Tuesday for the first time blamed senior Belarus officials for a hoax last year that grounded a Ryanair flight and led to the arrest of a dissident reporter. \n\nThe plane was on its way from Athens to Vilnius in May 2021 when Belarus controllers ordered it to land in Minsk, citing a bomb threat. Once it was on the ground, Belarus journalist Roman Protasevich was detained along with his girlfriend.\n\nThe UN's International Civil Aviation Organisation, which had previously said it did not know who was behind the hoax, condemned Minsk for \"committing an act of unlawful interference\" which contravened aviation rules.\n\n\"The ICAO Council acknowledged that the bomb threat against (the flight) ... was deliberately false and endangered its safety, and furthermore that the threat was communicated to the flight crew upon the instructions of senior government officials of Belarus,\" it said in a statement, citing new information.\n\nRussia's representative, it added, strongly objected to the conclusion. \n\n\n\nWestern nations have imposed sanctions against Minsk for supporting the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe Belarus foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters on the ICAO statement.\n\n\n\nMinsk previously said it acted legally and in accordance with all international norms, and accused the West of using the episode to try to undermine President Alexander Lukashenko.\n\nMr Protasevich, the former editor of a prominent opposition news outlet, renounced his political activism and was released from jail into house arrest. The opposition in Belarus believes his recantation was coerced.",

They board her first and she’s first to sit on the plane. \nAfter landing, this woman stays on the plane last, and is later escorted by someone into the airport. No handcuffs, no restraining action or anything. Just always escorted to and from the plane. Who was this person? Keep in mind the airport personnel were not armed security or anything like that.

    "text": "As the situation is ongoing and even tightening, please keep everything with regards to this topic here.\n\nBelow a run down on how we got to this point and some information \n\n**What's happening?**\n\nPoland and other EU countries have accused Belarus of trying to provoke a new refugee crisis in Europe in revenge for their criticism of Alexander Lukashenko’s brutal crackdown on opposition and European sanctions after the forced landing of a Ryanair flight in May, in effect opening up a new migration route to the bloc.\nTravel agencies are providing them with flights to Minsk and then a transfer to the EU’s external border. People can be charged €15,000-€20,000 (£12,800-£17,100) when they reach Belarus.\n\n\n\nMigrants attempting to cross from Belarus into the EU have become trapped between the two since October, when Polish police were authorised to summarily expel migrants and ignore asylum applications. Belarusian border guards refuse to allow them to turn back, meaning that people from countries including Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan are left in the inhospitable forests as temperatures drop below freezing.\n\n**Polish response:**\n\nPoland has deployed additional border guards, police and the military at its Belarus border. According to the Defense Ministry, the country now has 12,000 soldiers in the region, up from 10,000 deployed ahead of the latest developments. Members of Poland's army reserve in the border regions were also put on full alert.\n\n\nPoland has declared a state of emergency in a 3-kilometer-wide strip along its border with Belarus, preventing journalists from working there. That makes it difficult to ascertain what is happening in the zone, but there are many online reports of a large number of people moving toward the frontier.\n\nPoland has insisted on dealing with the crisis on its own, refusing offers of help from Frontex, the EU’s border agency which is headquartered in Warsaw.\n\nDonald Tusk, leader of the opposition Civic Platform party, said Poland should get help from its NATO allies by invoking an article that calls for consultation if an alliance member’s territory is under threat.\n\n\n\n**How has the EU responded?**\n\nPresident of the European Comission Ursula von der Leyen called on EU member states to approve extended sanctions against \"Belarusian authorities responsible for this hybrid attack.\"\n\n\"The Belarusian authorities must understand that pressuring the European Union in this way through a cynical instrumentalisation of migrants will not help them succeed in their purposes,\" she said in a statement. \n\nThe use \"of migrants for political purposes is unacceptable\", von der Leyen said, adding that the EU would also look at how to sanction \"third-country airlines\" that bring migrants to Belarus. \n\n\n\n**Situation is developing.**\n\nSome official links and footage: \n\n[Euronews with actual footage, Nov 8th](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf3HGFE6cds)\n\n[Twitter link to Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (in English)](https://twitter.com/PolandMFA)\n\n\n**UPDATE 11.11.2021**\n\n\n[The Embassy of the Republic of Iraq to the Russian Federation announces that it will organize an evacuation trip for Iraqi citizens wishing to return from the Republic of Belarus to Iraq](https://www.mofa.gov.iq/moscow/2021/11/11/%D8%B1%D8%AD%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7/)\n\n\n[Lukashenko ponders cutting gas supplies if EU levies more sanctions over migrants](https://www.euronews.com/2021/11/11/belarus-lukashenko-ponders-cutting-gas-supplies-if-eu-levies-more-sanctions-over-migrants)\n\n\n\n\n**We are aware that this is a hot topic at the moment and we would like to remind you that racism, advocating violence, hate speech, personal attacks and agenda pushing are still bannable offences**",
