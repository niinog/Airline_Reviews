    "text": "This article will delve into a specific facet of online travel booking that often leaves travelers scratching their heads: the airlines that *aren't* listed on those popular third-party sites like Expedia. We're diving deep to understand why some carriers choose to bypass these digital behemoths and where you can actually find their fares. It's more than just a simple list ‚Äì it's about understanding the intricate dance between airlines and travel agencies, the dynamics of direct booking versus aggregator platforms, and ultimately, how *you* can uncover the best deals and flight options by knowing where to look. Get ready to become a savvier traveler, armed with the knowledge to navigate the sometimes-confusing world of online flight searches. Let's unravel the mystery of what airlines are not on Expedia and why.\n\nThe Elusive Airlines: Why Some Fly Solo, Away from Expedia's Embrace\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEver felt like you're missing out on certain flight options when scrolling through Expedia? You're not imagining things! While Expedia and its ilk are fantastic tools, they don't have a complete monopoly on airfare listings. There's a whole contingent of airlines that prefer to play by their own rules, opting out of these massive online travel agencies (OTAs). This isn't some random decision, though. There are strategic reasons behind this \"go-it-alone\" approach, and understanding them is key to figuring out where to find those potentially hidden gems of flights. Think of it like shopping for a unique item ‚Äì you wouldn't find everything in a giant department store, right? Sometimes, you need to go directly to the source, and the same applies to certain airlines.\n\n### The \"Why\" Behind the Absence: Unpacking the Reasons\n\nSo, why do these airlines choose to be the wallflowers of the online travel world? It's not a single, simple answer. There's a complex interplay of business strategies, cost considerations, and a desire for greater control. Let's break down some of the key factors at play:\n\n- **Direct Booking is King (for Them):** Many airlines, especially the larger, established carriers, are heavily invested in driving traffic and bookings to their own websites. They see it as the most profitable channel. When you book directly, they don't have to pay a commission or fee to the OTA. Think of it as cutting out the middleman. This direct relationship also allows them to control the entire customer journey, from booking to post-flight service, which can be beneficial for building brand loyalty and offering personalized experiences.\n- **Controlling Their Brand and Customer Experience:** Airlines spend a fortune cultivating their brand image and crafting a specific customer experience. They worry that listing on a generic platform like Expedia can dilute their brand a bit. They want you to associate your flight experience directly with *them*, not a third-party site. Furthermore, booking directly allows them to handle customer service directly, which they might prefer, believing they can offer better or more consistent support than an OTA.\n- **Cost Savings are a Big Deal:** As mentioned before, OTAs charge commissions. These can be significant and eat into an airline's profit margins. By not listing on these platforms, airlines can potentially pass some of those savings on to the customer in the form of lower fares, or simply keep more of the revenue for themselves. Every penny counts in the highly competitive airline industry.\n- **Focus on Niche Markets and Routes:** Some airlines specialize in specific routes or operate primarily in particular regions. They might find less value in being on a global platform like Expedia if the majority of their target audience isn't typically using these sites for their specific needs. They might rely more on local marketing and direct sales.\n- **Legacy Systems and Technical Hurdles:** Believe it or not, integrating with massive platforms like Expedia isn't always a walk in the park. Some airlines, particularly smaller or older ones, might have legacy booking systems that are difficult or expensive to connect with these modern OTAs. It‚Äôs not always a strategic choice; sometimes, it's a technical limitation.\n\nThese are just some of the driving forces behind an airline's decision to go rogue from the major OTAs. It's a strategic calculation based on their business model, target market, and operational capabilities.\n\nThis next section dives into the heart of the matter ‚Äì providing you with actionable information. We've explored *why* some airlines aren't on Expedia, and now we're going to tell you *which* ones are often missing from this popular platform. Knowing this is the first step to expanding your flight search horizons and potentially snagging a better deal or a more convenient route. Get ready to add some new names to your travel vocabulary!\n\n### The Usual Suspects: Airlines You Won't Typically Find on Expedia\n\nAlright, let's get down to brass tacks. While the landscape can change, and some brief partnerships might occur, there's a pretty consistent list of airlines you'll likely *not* find readily available for booking on Expedia. It's important to remember that this isn't an exhaustive, unchanging encyclopedia, but these are the airlines that generally prioritize direct bookings and their own distribution channels. Knowing these names is crucial for a truly comprehensive flight search.\n\n- **Some of the Ultra-Low-Cost Carriers (ULCCs):** This is a big one. Many ULCCs, both in the US and internationally, have built their business model around direct sales and stripping away any extra costs, including OTA commissions. Airlines like:\n    \n    \n    - **Spirit Airlines:** A major player in the US ULCC scene, Spirit is notorious for its low base fares and extensive fees. You'll almost always find their best (and sometimes only) prices on their own website.\n    - **Frontier Airlines:** Similar to Spirit, Frontier is another US-based ULCC that heavily pushes direct bookings.\n    - **Ryanair:** A giant in the European ULCC market, Ryanair is famous for its incredibly low fares and direct-to-consumer approach. You won't find their flights on most major OTAs.\n    - **Wizz Air:** Another prominent European ULCC, Wizz Air also focuses on direct sales.\n    - And many other regional or less globally recognized ULCCs around the world.\n- **Certain Smaller, Regional Airlines:** Airlines that primarily serve smaller markets or specific routes might also choose to bypass major OTAs. Their customer base might be more localized, and they might not see the value in the global reach of platforms like Expedia.\n- **Some Luxury or Boutique Airlines:** Airlines that cater to a very specific, high-end market might prefer to manage their bookings directly to maintain a personalized touch and control the entire customer experience from start to finish.\n- **A Few National Flag Carriers (in specific instances):** While many national flag carriers *do* list on OTAs, there can be exceptions, especially for specific routes or during certain promotional periods. It's always worth checking their direct website even if you see them listed elsewhere.\n\nIt's important to note that even if an airline isn't typically on Expedia, they might still partner with other, perhaps smaller or more specialized, travel agencies. But for the big hitters like Expedia, Priceline, and the like, the airlines listed above are often absent friends.\n\nThis next section tackles a critically important question: \"Okay, I know *which* airlines are not on Expedia, but where on earth do I find their flights?\" This is where your savvy traveler skills come into play. While it might require a little more effort than a one-stop-shop search on an OTA, knowing where to look for these \"missing\" airlines can open up a whole new world of possibilities, potentially saving you money or providing you with more convenient flight times.\n\n### The Hunt is On: Where to Find Those Elusive Fares\n\nSo, if you can't just type in your destination on Expedia and expect to see every single flight option, where *do* you go? The answer is multifaceted, and becoming a successful flight hunter means knowing which tools to use for which job. Think of it like having a toolbox ‚Äì different screws require different screwdrivers! Here's where you should be looking to uncover those flights from airlines that are not on Expedia:\n\n- **The Airline's Official Website:** This is your absolute number one resource. If you suspect an airline flies a route you're interested in, go directly to their website. This is where you will find their most up-to-date schedules, fares, and potentially exclusive deals or loyalty program benefits. Remember, airlines *want* you to book directly; they often make it easy and sometimes even incentivize it.\n- **Google Flights:** This is an invaluable tool that scrapes data from various sources, including many airlines directly. While it might not always show *every single* flight from every single airline (especially the super niche ones), it's significantly better than many traditional OTAs for showing a broader range of options, including those from some ULCCs. It's also fantastic for exploring different dates and destinations with its calendar and map features. Think of it as a powerful aggregator, but with a wider net than Expedia for certain carriers.\n- **Skiplagged:** This website specifically highlights \"hidden city\" ticketing opportunities (though be aware of the potential risks and airline policies surrounding this practice). However, it also often includes flights from airlines that don't appear on mainstream OTAs, particularly ULCCs, as it pulls data from various sources. Use with caution and research the implications of hidden city ticketing thoroughly!\n- **Kayak:** While Kayak is also an aggregator, it sometimes pulls in data from different sources than Expedia and can occasionally show flights from airlines that you might not find elsewhere on OTAs. It's worth including in your search arsenal as a comparison tool.\n- **Momondo:** Similar to Kayak, Momondo is another strong flight search engine that aggregates deals from various providers. It's known for its visually appealing interface and can sometimes unearth interesting combinations or airlines not shown on other platforms.\n- **Airline-Specific Apps and Email Lists:** If you frequently fly a particular airline, especially one that's not always on OTAs, download their app and sign up for their email list. This is where they'll announce sales, promotions, and new routes first.\n\nBy using a combination of these resources, you'll significantly increase your chances of finding the flights you're looking for, even those from airlines that deliberately avoid the Expedia ecosystem.\n\nFinding flights from airlines not listed on Expedia might seem like a hurdle, but it presents a unique opportunity to dig a little deeper and potentially unearth some fantastic deals or more convenient travel options. This next section focuses on empowering you with the knowledge and strategies to navigate this landscape effectively. It‚Äôs about becoming a more informed and efficient traveler in the digital age.\n\n### Becoming an Expert Flight Finder: Strategies for Success\n\nNow that you know *why* some airlines avoid Expedia and *where* to generally look for their flights, let's talk about honing your skills as a flight finder. It‚Äôs not just about plugging in dates and hoping for the best; it‚Äôs about having a strategy and knowing how to leverage the tools available to you. Think of it like being a detective, piecing together clues to find the perfect travel solution.\n\n- **Be Flexible (If You Can):** This is arguably the biggest game-changer. Being flexible with your travel dates, times, and even your departure or arrival airport can dramatically impact the prices you find and the airlines available to you. Airlines that aren't on Expedia, particularly ULCCs, often have the most attractive fares on less popular travel days and times. Using flexible search tools like Google Flights' calendar view is invaluable here.\n- **Search Directly First:** Before you even *think* about an OTA, if you have a specific airline in mind (perhaps one known for its low fares on a certain route, even if it's not on Expedia), go to their website first. You might be surprised at the direct-booking deals you find.\n- **Utilize Aggregators Beyond the Usual Suspects:** As mentioned earlier, explore Google Flights, Kayak, and Momondo. These platforms often pull in data from a wider range of airlines, including some that bypass Expedia. Don't rely solely on one search engine.\n- **Compare Apples to Apples (and Oranges to Oranges):** When comparing prices from different sources, be absolutely sure you're comparing the total cost. Those super-low fares from ULCCs not on Expedia often don't include baggage fees, seat selection fees, or even carry-on bag fees. Add all those potential extras in to get a true comparison. A seemingly cheaper flight on a ULCC's website might end up being *more* expensive than a slightly higher base fare on a full-service carrier listed on Expedia once all the fees are factored in.\n- **Consider the Convenience Factor:** While finding the cheapest fare is often the goal, sometimes convenience is king. A direct flight on an airline not on Expedia might be worth a little extra compared to a multi-stop journey on an airline you found on an OTA. Factor in travel time, layovers, and airport convenience.\n- **Don't Be Afraid to Mix and Match:** Sometimes the best itinerary involves booking separate one-way tickets on different airlines, potentially even combining a flight on an airline not on Expedia with one you found there. This can be a little more work and comes with potential risks if one leg of your journey is delayed or cancelled, but it can also unlock some real savings or better timing.\n- **Sign Up for Airline Newsletters and Follow Them on Social Media:** Airlines, especially ULCCs, frequently announce sales and promotions through these channels *before* or *instead of* listing them on OTAs. Being in the loop can give you a heads-up on great deals.\n- **Clear Your Cookies and Use Incognito Mode:** While airlines and booking sites deny it influences pricing, many travelers swear by clearing their browser cookies or using incognito mode when searching for flights. It's a simple step that can't hurt!\n\nBy adopting these strategies, you‚Äôll become a more empowered and effective flight searcher, capable of navigating the complex world of online booking and uncovering opportunities you might otherwise miss.\n\n\"Save up to 90% on flights with these amazing deals: https://educdunet.com/\"\n\nWe've explored the \"why\" and the \"where,\" and now we're going to delve into a crucial aspect of booking with airlines that are less visible on mainstream OTAs: understanding the nuances and potential trade-offs. It's not always a straightforward \"cheaper is better\" scenario. Knowing what to expect and what to look out for is essential for a smooth travel experience, especially when dealing with airlines that operate differently. Get ready to learn about the fine print and the realities of flying with carriers that prioritize direct bookings.\n\n### Navigating the Nuances: What to Expect When Booking Directly (and Exclusively)\n\nBooking directly with an airline, especially one that deliberately avoids major OTAs like Expedia, comes with its own set of considerations. It's usually a deliberate choice by the consumer aiming for a potentially lower price or a specific route, but it's important to be aware of the potential differences in the booking experience and the implications for your trip.\n\n- **Airline-Specific Terms and Conditions:** When you book directly, you are subject solely to that airline's terms and conditions of carriage. These can differ significantly from airline to airline and may have different policies regarding cancellations, changes, baggage, and denied boarding compared to what you might be accustomed to when booking through a larger OTA (which might have its own layer of booking terms). Always read the fine print!\n- **Customer Service Direct from the Source:** If something goes wrong ‚Äì a flight delay, cancellation, or a baggage issue ‚Äì you'll be dealing directly with the airline's customer service department. This can be a good thing, as they are the ultimate authority on their operations. However, the quality and responsiveness of airline customer service can vary *greatly*. Be prepared to potentially spend time on hold or navigating automated systems.\n- **Add-on Fees are Par for the Course (Especially with ULCCs):** As we touched on earlier, those incredibly low base fares offered by airlines not on Expedia, particularly ULCCs, often come with a long list of potential add-on fees. These can include fees for:\n    \n    \n    - Checked baggage\n    - Carry-on baggage (yes, even for what you might consider a standard carry-on!)\n    - Seat selection (even choosing a basic seat)\n    - Printing your boarding pass at the airport\n    - Food and drinks onboard\n    - Priority boarding\n    - Changes or cancellations\n    \n    It's absolutely imperative to factor in all these potential fees when comparing the total cost of your ticket. What seems cheap upfront might not be the case in the end.\n- **Less Centralized Information:** When you book multiple legs of a journey on different airlines through a major OTA, the OTA often acts as a central point of contact for all your flight information. When you book directly with separate airlines, you'll need to manage each booking individually. This means keeping track of multiple confirmation numbers, checking in separately, and being responsible for coordinating connections if you've booked separate tickets.\n- **Lack of a Third-Party Advocate:** If you have a dispute with an airline, booking through a major OTA can sometimes provide an extra layer of support or advocacy. While not always guaranteed, the OTA might intervene on your behalf in certain situations. When you book directly, you're on your own in dealing with the airline.\n- **Potential for Less Convenient Booking Interfaces:** While many airlines have excellent websites and apps, some smaller carriers or those with older systems might have less user-friendly booking platforms compared to the polished interfaces of major OTAs.\n\nNone of these are necessarily reasons *not* to book with an airline simply because they aren't on Expedia, but they are important factors to be aware of so you can go into the process with your eyes wide open. Forewarned is forearmed!\n\nThis next section expands our view beyond just the major airlines. The world of air travel is vast and includes numerous smaller players, regional carriers, and even specialized charter services. Understanding how these different types of airlines operate and where to find their listings is crucial for anyone looking to explore every possible travel option, especially for less common routes or destinations.\n\n### Beyond the Big Guys: Regional, Charter, and Other Not-So-Expedia Airlines\n\nWhile the major international and domestic carriers get most of the attention, a significant portion of air travel is handled by smaller, more specialized airlines. These are often the airlines that are less likely to have a major presence on global platforms like Expedia. Knowing how to find information and book with these carriers is key for accessing niche routes or specific types of air travel.\n\n- **Regional Airlines:** These airlines typically operate shorter flights within a specific geographical region, often feeding passengers to larger hubs or connecting smaller cities. They might be branded under a major airline's name (as a \"regional partner\") but are operated by a separate company. Their flights might appear on OTAs when they are part of a larger itinerary booked through a partner airline, but booking directly with the regional carrier for individual flights might not be possible or is less common. Finding their independent routes often requires searching specific regional airport websites or using aggregators that specialize in regional travel.\n- **Charter Airlines:** These airlines don't operate on a fixed schedule like commercial airlines. Instead, they are hired for specific flights, often for tour operators, sports teams, or private groups. You won't find their flights on Expedia because they aren't available for public booking in the traditional sense. If you're interested in charter travel, you'd need to go through a charter broker or a company that specializes in arranging charter flights.\n- **Specialty Airlines:** This category includes airlines that serve very specific purposes, such as cargo airlines, air ambulances, or airlines that operate scenic flights or specialized tours. These are obviously not going to be on a consumer-focused OTA like Expedia.\n- **Membership-Based or Fractional Ownership Programs:** Airlines that operate on a membership or fractional ownership model (like some private jet services) are not available on public booking platforms. You'd need to be a member or owner to access their flights.\n\nThe key takeaway here is that the world of air travel extends far beyond the airlines you see on Expedia. If you're looking for a specific, less common route or a particular type of air service, you might need to broaden your search beyond the usual OTAs and look into the operations of regional, charter, or specialty carriers that might not have a public listing on those platforms. It's about understanding the different facets of the airline industry.\n\nThis next section is a direct response to the title's core question. We've covered the *why* and the *where*, and now we're explicitly listing some of the most common airlines you'll find absent from Expedia. This serves as a quick reference guide for travelers who are specifically looking for flights on these carriers and are wondering why they aren't showing up in their usual searches.\n\nWhat Airlines Are Not on Expedia? A Quick Reference Guide\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor those of you who just want the straight scoop, here‚Äôs a list of some of the major airlines that are frequently *not* listed on Expedia. Remember, the online travel landscape is fluid, and occasional partnerships or temporary listings might occur, but these carriers generally prioritize direct bookings and their own distribution channels. If you're looking for flights on these airlines, head directly to their websites or use alternative search tools as discussed earlier. This isn't an exhaustive list of every single airline in the world that isn't on Expedia, but it covers many of the most prominent ones that travelers often look for.\n\n- **Spirit Airlines:** A major US-based ultra-low-cost carrier.\n- **Frontier Airlines:** Another prominent US ultra-low-cost carrier.\n- **Ryanair:** A massive European ultra-low-cost carrier.\n- **Wizz Air:** A significant European ultra-low-cost carrier.\n- **Allegiant Air:** A US-based ultra-low-cost carrier focusing on leisure travel to smaller cities.\n- **Certain smaller, regional airlines operating independently (not as a partner to a major carrier):** It's difficult to list all of these as they are numerous and often operate locally. If you're searching for flights to or from a smaller airport, investigate the airlines that serve that specific location directly.\n\nThis list provides a starting point for your flight searches, helping you avoid frustration when these airlines don't appear on Expedia.\n\nNow that we've covered which airlines are typically absent from Expedia, let's consider the practical implications for you, the traveler. How does this knowledge actually help you plan your trips more effectively? This section focuses on leveraging the information we've discussed to become a savvier and more efficient traveler, ensuring you find the best options for your needs, even if it means looking beyond the most popular online travel agency.\n\n### Leveraging the Knowledge: How Knowing \"What Airlines Are Not on Expedia\" Helps You\n\nUnderstanding which airlines aren't on Expedia isn't just some trivial piece of information; it's a powerful tool in your travel planning arsenal. This knowledge can directly impact the flights you find, the prices you pay, and ultimately, the success of your trip. Here's how knowing \"what airlines are not on Expedia\" can give you an edge:\n\n- **Finding Cheaper Fares:** As we‚Äôve discussed, airlines that prioritize direct bookings, particularly ULCCs, often offer their lowest fares exclusively on their own websites. By knowing which airlines are in this category, you can bypass Expedia and go straight to the source, potentially saving a significant amount of money, especially on short-haul flights or when you can travel light.\n- **Accessing More Flight Options:** For certain routes, especially those served by regional airlines or less globally known carriers, knowing where to look outside of Expedia can reveal flight options you wouldn't otherwise see. This can be crucial for reaching smaller airports or finding more convenient schedules.\n- **Avoiding Frustration During Your Search:** Imagine searching for hours on Expedia for a flight you suspect exists, only to find nothing. Knowing that certain airlines don't list there can save you time and frustration. You can quickly pivot to a direct search on the airline's website or an alternative aggregator.\n- **Potentially Finding Direct Routes on ULCCs:** Sometimes, a ULCC not on Expedia might offer a direct flight on a route where other carriers listed on Expedia only offer connecting flights. If a direct flight is a priority for you, knowing which ULCCs fly that route and checking their websites directly is essential.\n- **Better Understanding the Total Cost of Travel:** Knowing that airlines not on Expedia often have a hefty list of ancillaries forces you to consider the total cost of your trip upfront. This proactive approach helps you budget accurately and avoid unpleasant surprises at the airport.\n- **Empowering Your Travel Decisions:** Ultimately, being aware of the airlines that operate outside the Expedia sphere gives you more control over your travel planning. You‚Äôre not limited by the offerings of a single platform; you have the knowledge to cast a wider net and find the best fit for your specific travel needs and budget.\n\nIn essence, this knowledge transforms you from a passive consumer relying on a single platform to an active participant in the flight search process, armed with the information to uncover hidden gems and potentially better deals.\n\nThis final section before the conclusion provides a summary of the key takeaways from our exploration of airlines that aren't on Expedia. It serves as a quick recap of the most important points to remember as you embark on your flight searches, empowering you to make informed decisions and find the best travel solutions for your next adventure.\n\n### Summing It Up: Key Takeaways for Savvy Travelers\n\nWe've covered a lot of ground exploring the world of airlines that are not on Expedia. Here's a quick recap of the most important things to keep in mind as you plan your next trip:\n\n1. **Expedia doesn't have every airline:** Don't assume that a search on Expedia will show you every single flight option available. Many airlines, particularly ULCCs and some regional carriers, prioritize direct bookings.\n2. **Know the \"usual suspects\":** Be aware of airlines like Spirit, Frontier, Ryanair, and Wizz Air, which are frequently absent from major OTAs.\n3. **Head directly to the airline's website:** This is your primary resource for finding flights on airlines that aren't on Expedia.\n4. **Utilize alternative search tools:** Google Flights, Kayak, and Momondo can often show a wider range of airlines compared to traditional OTAs.\n5. **Factor in the total cost:** When comparing fares from airlines not on Expedia, especially ULCCs, always add up all potential fees (baggage, seat selection, etc.) to get a true comparison.\n6. **Be flexible with your travel dates and times:** This is key to finding the best deals, especially on airlines that prioritize direct bookings.\n7. **Understand the nuances of direct booking:** Be prepared to deal directly with the airline for customer service and understand their specific terms and conditions.\n8. **Consider regional and specialty carriers for less common routes:** If you're looking for flights to smaller airports or for specific purposes, you might need to look beyond the typical airlines and platforms.\n9. **Knowing which airlines are not on Expedia empowers your travel planning:** This knowledge allows you to broaden your search, potentially find cheaper fares, access more options, and make more informed travel decisions.\n\nBy keeping these points in mind, you'll be well-equipped to navigate the complexities of the online travel world and find the best flight options for your needs, even if they aren't listed on every single platform. Happy travels!\n\n\"Save up to 90% on flights with these amazing deals: https://educdunet.com/\"\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nSo there you have it! Delving into the world of what airlines are not on Expedia reveals a fascinating layer to online travel booking. It's clear that while platforms like Expedia offer incredible convenience, they don't provide a complete picture of the airline landscape. By understanding why some carriers ‚Äì particularly ultra-low-cost and certain regional airlines ‚Äì choose to operate outside these major OTAs, and more importantly, by knowing *where* to find their flights (hint: usually their own websites and alternative aggregators!), you become a much more savvy and resourceful traveler.\n\nThis knowledge isn't just academic; it has tangible benefits. It can lead you to cheaper fares, unlock access to more convenient routes, and save you time and frustration during your planning process. Remember to always consider the total cost of your ticket, including all those potential add-on fees, and be prepared to interact directly with the airline for any customer service needs.\n\nIn a world where information is key, knowing the ins and outs of flight distribution gives you a distinct advantage. So, the next time you're planning a trip, think beyond the usual suspects on Expedia. Explore, compare, and leverage your newfound knowledge to find the perfect flight for your journey. Happy hunting, and even happier travels!",

The ‚ÄúDecoy Wallet‚Äù Trick\n\n*\"Lost $80 in Rome to a pickpocket. Now I carry a fake wallet with expired cards and small cash. Real money stays in a sock or hidden belt pouch.\"*\n\n* **Works in**: Europe (Barcelona metros), India (train stations), Peru (bus terminals).\n\n# 2. The ‚ÄúGoogle Maps Offline‚Äù Lifesaver\n\n*\"Stranded in Hanoi with no WiFi, I walked 45 mins to my hostel because I‚Äôd forgotten to download the map. Now I star my hostel, ATMs, and police stations before arriving.\"*\n\n* **How-to**: Type¬†*\"OK maps\"*¬†in Google Maps to save areas offline.\n\n# 3. The ‚ÄúTaxi Selfie‚Äù Rule\n\n*\"A Bangkok taxi driver ‚Äòforgot‚Äô to turn on the meter. Now I snap a photo of the license plate and text it to a friend before getting in.\"*\n\n* **Extra layer**: Use ride apps (Uber/Didi/Grab) with driver profiles.\n\n# 4. The ‚ÄúSIM Card Shield‚Äù\n\n\\*\"Bought a ‚Äòtourist SIM‚Äô in Istanbul for $50‚Ä¶ only to find locals pay $10. Now I walk 10 mins away from airports to buy from carrier stores (look for ‚ÄòTurkcell/Vodafone‚Äô logos).\"\\*\n\n* **Best SIM deals**:\n   * Mexico: Telcel ($10/2GB)\n   * Thailand: AIS ($5/15GB)\n   * Japan: Sakura Mobile ($20/unlimited)\n\n# 5.

A $6 rubber doorstop from Amazon now gives me peace of mind.\"*\n\n* **Also works for**: Sleeper trains, Airbnb stays, capsule hotels.\n\n# 6. The ‚ÄúLocal Outfit Test‚Äù\n\n*\"Got charged triple at a Marrakech market until I swapped my shorts for linen pants. Dressing slightly like a local = fewer scams.\"*\n\n* **Key items**:\n   * Southeast Asia: Cover shoulders/knees for temples\n   * Middle East: Loose clothing (men too!)\n   * Europe: Avoid ‚ÄòI ‚ù§ \\[City\\]‚Äô shirts \n\n# 7. The ‚ÄúATM Ambush Avoidance‚Äù\n\n*\"A ‚Äòhelpful‚Äô stranger in Bogot√° skimmed my card. Now I only use ATMs inside banks during daylight‚Äîand cover the keypad like a spy.\"*\n\n* **Skimming hotspots**: Tourist areas in Mexico, Thailand, Spain.\n\n# Bonus: My ‚Äú3-2-1 Emergency Rule‚Äù\n\n* **3 copies**¬†of passport/visas (phone, email, physical)\n* **2 payment methods**¬†(card + emergency cash in USD/EUR)\n* **1 trusted contact**¬†who knows your itinerary\n\n*\"These tricks saved me in Venezuela blackouts, Cairo scams, and a Manila typhoon.

      "I think coverage depends on the reason for the delay that caused you to misconnect.  A weather delay might be a \"covered reason\" but a mechanical delay might not, because most insurance policies expect airlines compensate you for mechanical delays but not weather delays.\n\nIn the EU, don't you already get compensation for delays of 3 hours or more?",
      "It's difficult to give provider names without knowing where you are, but if I were in your shoes I'd also look at policies that cover not missed connections specifically but delays (in blocks of x hours) in general. \n\nI have, just half a year ago, made a successful claim against a 24-hr delay that led to me missing my train, at $100 for every six hours of delay. That $400 pretty much covered the cost of the last minute flight purchase I had to make to catch up on my itin.\n\nTo make this work, however, you'll still have to make sure you give yourself plenty of buffer for the self-transfer, including for terminal switches if any."

      "Many people stay at low-cost airlines because of a prefered base or rostering. There's the ocasional joke about Ryanair and hard landings, but more of a humour thing than actual ''looking down''. Ryanair as far as I know has one of the most thorough trainings.",
      "There's plenty of people who stay at low-cost forever. Mostly because they have a base at their home. Bases open and close all the time though so it's not very stable.\n\nAbsolutely noone cares where you earn your money",
      "Low Cost carriers need experienced people too so they must make it interesting enough to retain them. I would argue a captain on a Ryanair 737 with 10,000 hours and a gazillion landings has way better piloting skills than a 777 captain with 10,000 hours who does one landing every 2-3 days. \n\nAt the end of the day the companies run different business models but you are always a type rated pilot on an airframe, no matter the Lufthansa logo on Ryanair logo on it. \n\nI'll give you the example of Luxair. Yeah the salaries could be higher BUT the fleet leaves every morning to their destinations and all of the aircraft besides I think the Dubai flight return the same evening back to their home base. If you value family life / social life it is kinda the golden goose as you fall every evening into your own bed.",
      "To say it bluntly, nobody cares and so shouldn't you. Whatever pays the bills and makes you happy.\n\nThe pros of LLCs and ULLCs are usually stable rosters, stable pay, massive experience gained in short times and plenty of base options so it's likely there's one near you if you care to stay close to your place.\n\nA practical example: our local international airport in Italy is both a Ryanair and easyJet base. Ryanair is famous for their incredible roster - 5 days on 4 days off is very good. You always know when you will be working, even years in advance. easyJet on the other hand has a less stable roster but better pay, profit sharing and will arrange for both accomodation and transportation when time for you OPC/LCP comes, something that Ryanair will leave you to deal with instead. \n\nI know people in both companies that cannot wait to join the other. So you decide and don't let peer pressure motivate your decisions because it just doesn't exist. Life is too short to care.",
      "The only people who care are people outside the industry. They see a flag carrier flying transatlantic as the goal and anything else as temporary. People with no idea will shit on Ryanair for having bad pilots or whatever (there's definitely a conversation to be had about selection), but in reality their training is excellent. They allow you to live just about anywhere and if it works for you, then do it. Realistically, live life for you, whatever you do there'll be someone judging you for it, imo so long as whatever you're doing isn't hurting people (tbh I'm really just thinking of scabbing) then do whatever you want."

We told them we are UAE residents and Pakistani National.\n\nThey heard ‚ÄúPakistan‚Äù and a guy from police asked us to come on the side, took our passports, took our pictures in front of all people, which was very humiliating. And went to some room, they did not tell us anything or ask for anything, didn‚Äôt even ask for our documents. \n\nWe kept asking but they were rude and kept saying stay standing in the corner\n\nAfter 20 minutes, a lady came out with some pages in her hand, took us to a room and told us \n\n‚ÄúYou are not allowed to enter Georgia.

    "title": "Tip for travellers leaving from the EU",
    "text": "Hi everyone! Wanted to share a personal experience which got me a considerable refund of 600‚Ç¨ on a long haul flight from Madrid to Brazil.\n\nMost in here will be familiar with the EU Regulation No [261/2004](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2004/261/oj/eng#:~:text=Regulation%20%28EC%29%20No%20261%2F2004%20of%20the%20European%20Parliament,of%20flights%2C%20and%20repealing%20Regulation%20%28EEC%29%20No%20295%2F91), which stipulates your right to compensation on delays to flights leaving the EU. I do think my specific experience was instructive trying to action this as I was stonewalled pretty bad by Air Europa but managed in the end to get it.   \n  \nMy flight got a busted tire or something like that when taking off, so basically we had to stop, leave and wait for over 5 hours. So this was max. distance max. delay so it was the highest compensation level.\n\nI raised this with Air Europa which gave me a couple corporate answers which basically said \"we're not going to compensate you, the motives for the delay were due to reasons outside of our control\" - which is what's stipulated on the regulation, so something if it is due to weather per example, you won't get compensated. Obviously in my case, the tire or any issue concerning the aircraft is well within their control. But they just kept copy pasting corporate jargon at my replies, so there's was no arguing with them.\n\nSo I went to Spain's aviation authority, which was a nightmare of a website which really tested me for months lol. In the end, after many failed attempts and procrastination to go back to that god forsaken platform, I managed to submit the complain. Two months later they got back to me saying I have to raise this up with the Portuguese aviation authority, because that's where the trip began and Madrid was the layover. So a quick note there, even if the delay is from elsewhere on the layover, you complain wherever the trip started.\n\nAnother note is that you're entitled to this compensation no matter your destination as long as you're leaving from the EU. So going to Brazil made no difference, the flight is still subject to EU law. The Portuguese website was, thankfully, much more sane and I was able to submit the complaint easily. The Portuguese aviation authority sent Air Europa a request for clarification not too long after that, and low and behold, here comes Air Europa with an e-mail offering the owed compensation after a weeks stonewalling me.\n\nI've heard of Wizz Air being pretty cool about it and immediately paying the compensation open request,  but it wouldn't surprise me if denying claims was standard procedure in some airlines in hopes that people just give up on it because they're not aware of their rights or just too tired to go through the hassle of filling the forms and going through all the motions to get a complaint through. At the end of the day, they won't get fined or lose anything if they ultimately comply with an authority's request.\n\nAnd thus came to an end an almost year long journey for me. So If you ever find yourself in this situation, I'd recommend taking the effort of raising a complaint as you can get up to 600‚Ç¨ back if the  delay is over two hours long.",

    "text": "**Itinerary: round trip,  Budapest - Baku 10 July, Baku - Budapest 12 August.**\n\n**Citizenship: Hungarian citizen. Requires an eVisa to enter Azerbaijan. eVisa is valid for single entry.**\n\n**Carrier:** Wizz Air.\n\n**The problem**\n\n*Wizz Air has a validation in place at the online check-in, where they expect your visa to be valid until the end of your trip. Sounds logical, yes. Except it doesn't consider the (presumably uncommon) situation in which you are obliged to have two visas. How does that happen, you might ask. Well, unlike what the itinerary suggests, I don't intend to spend much time in Azerbaijan.* The trip is like this:\n\n\n\nFoo | Bar | text\n---|---|----\nDate| Event| Comment\n10 JUL| Enter Azerbaijan: BUD - GYD | eVisa no. 1 to be used for entry (Valid 02 May - 31 July)\n11 JUL | Leave Azerbaijan | eVisa no. 1 to be used for exit - becomes void\n....|....|....\n11 AUG| Enter Azerbaijan | eVisa no. 2 to be used for entry (Valid 01 Aug - 30 Oct)\n12 AUG | Leave Azerbaijan: GYD - BUD | eVisa no. 2 to be used for exit - becomes void\n\n(NB: This approach was confirmed by the Azeri authorities to be OK. A person may hold multiple eVisas and can use them as long as the visas are used in a consistent, non-fraudulent manner, without mix-ups. The written confirmation is in front of me. I also checked it in Timatic - seemed ok. Appreciate if we don't focus on this.)\n\n**However, as established, Wizz Air expects a single visa that must be valid for the entire duration of the trip. In other words, I will have a mismatch: I either have to input eVisa number 001 with a different end of validity date, or I have to use eVisa number 002 which is not valid on 10 July, when I leave.**\n\n**Mitigation technics**\n\nI see only two options.\n\nOption 1: After spending the past 2 days calling Wizz Air (and explaining the situation to 5 different people like a broken record) their official account of the situation is to just ignore the online check-in and take care of it in person, at the check-in desk on the day of the flight. Benefit: no additional cost. Concern: how exactly can I be sure that the clerk will fully comprehend the situation and I will not have problems?\n\nOption 2: Alternatively, I can request a third visa that covers the whole time frame and I can bypass this validation. I consider this situation to be tantamount to wearing a clown suit and getting fleeced because it absolutely doesn't make sense and I totally don't need a third visa. Benefit: in theory, peace of mind. Concern: unclear if this will not raise a couple of red flags that I need three eVisas in such short time, plus let's be fucking honest, I'm paying for bureaucracy, a flawed validation rule.\n\nWhat to do? I feel both options are far from ideal.",

    "title": "Countries with the Cheapest Flights: Discover Affordable Travel Destinations",
    "text": "Okay, pack your bags, or at least start dreaming! Let's dive deep into the wonderful world of affordable air travel.\n\nFinding the perfect vacation spot is one thing, but getting there without completely blowing your budget before you even arrive? Now *that's* the real travel hack, isn't it? We all crave that feeling of stepping off the plane in a brand-new place, suitcase in hand, ready to explore, but the price of that plane ticket can often feel like a giant roadblock before the adventure even begins. It's easy to get discouraged scrolling through flight comparison sites, watching those numbers tick higher and higher. You see gorgeous photos of exotic locales online and think, \"Yeah, right, maybe someday when pigs fly *and* buy me a ticket.\" But what if \"someday\" could be sooner than you think? What if there are actual places where the flight *itself* isn't the astronomical hurdle you've come to expect? That's precisely what we're here to unearth today. We're going to explore not just destinations that are cheap once you get there (that's a whole other amazing list!), but the *countries with the cheapest flights* to begin with. Get ready to have your travel horizons expanded and your wallet sigh a breath of relief.\n\n### The Alchemy of Airfares: Why Some Tickets Cost a Fortune and Others Feel Like a Steal\n\nHave you ever wondered what magical (or perhaps maddening) formula airlines use to price their tickets? Sometimes a flight to a seemingly close destination costs more than hopping across an ocean! Understanding *why* certain flights are cheaper than others is the first crucial step in the global scavenger hunt for the best deals, particularly when looking at different **countries with the cheapest flights**. It's not just random; there are concrete factors at play, a sort of economic and logistical alchemy that determines the price you see on the screen. Getting a handle on these elements can turn you from a bewildered browser into a savvy flight detective. So, before we jet off virtually to our affordable destinations, let's peek behind the curtain and see what makes airfares tick.\n\n### Unpacking the Price Tag: Key Factors Influencing Flight Costs\n\nAirfares are a complex beast, a dynamic dance between supply, demand, competition, and a whole heap of other variables. It's like trying to predict the weather, but with more algorithms involved. When you're searching for **countries with the cheapest flights**, you're essentially looking for destinations where this complex interplay of factors tends to push prices *downwards*. Knowing what these factors are helps you understand *why* certain routes or destinations are consistently more affordable and gives you clues on *how* to time your searches and trips for maximum savings.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- **Competition is King (or Queen):** This is perhaps the biggest driver of cheap flights. If multiple airlines (especially budget carriers!) fly a specific route or compete fiercely for passengers heading to a particular country, they're forced to lower prices to stay competitive. Direct routes from major hubs with lots of carriers are often cheaper than niche routes with only one or two options. Think of it like a marketplace ‚Äì more vendors selling similar goods usually means better prices for the buyer!\n- **Geographic Location and Hubs:** Countries that serve as major international hubs or are strategically located on popular flight paths often benefit from more frequent flights and, therefore, potentially lower prices. Being a jumping-off point or a common connecting city increases traffic and competition. Flying into a massive airport in Europe, for instance, might be cheaper than flying into a smaller, regional airport in the same general area.\n- **Economic Conditions:** The economic health of both the departure and arrival countries plays a role. Fuel prices are a massive cost for airlines, and global economic conditions affect these. Furthermore, airlines might adjust pricing strategy based on the economic situation and demand in a particular region. A country experiencing lower demand might see airlines drop prices to fill seats.\n- **Seasonality and Demand:** This is a no-brainer, right? Flying during peak tourist season (like summer in Europe or holidays everywhere) will almost always be more expensive. Airlines charge what the market will bear. Conversely, traveling during the shoulder season (spring/fall) or the low season usually results in significant price drops. Looking for cheap flights? Off-peak is your friend!\n- **Duration of Trip and Day of the Week:** Airlines often price flights favouring stays that include a Saturday night (targeting leisure travelers who might be less price-sensitive than business travelers). Flying mid-week is frequently cheaper than flying on Fridays or Sundays.\n- **Taxes and Fees:** Government taxes, airport fees, and fuel surcharges are built into the ticket price. These can vary significantly from country to country and airport to airport. Some destinations simply have lower associated fees.\n- **How Far in Advance You Book:** While there's no single magic number, booking too early (before airlines finalize schedules and pricing strategies) or too late (when only expensive seats are left) can cost you. There's often a \"sweet spot,\" typically a few months out for international flights, though this can vary wildly.\n\nUnderstanding these factors helps demystify flight pricing and sets the stage for identifying *which* countries are more likely to appear on lists of affordable flight destinations. It's not just random chance; it's often due to a consistent presence of these price-depressing factors.\n\n### The Quest for the Affordable Horizon: Defining \"Cheapest Flights\"\n\nOkay, so when we talk about **countries with the cheapest flights**, what exactly do we *mean*? Are we talking about the absolute lowest dollar amount you can pay for a one-way ticket, even if it's a miserable 30-hour journey with three layovers? Or are we considering relative value, perhaps a combination of a decent price for a reasonable route, coupled with the fact that once you arrive, the overall cost of exploring that country is also budget-friendly? For this deep dive, we're going for a bit of both, leaning towards destinations that frequently feature low airfares, often thanks to the factors we just discussed, and are generally accessible without breaking the bank *just* on the flight. We're looking for those sweet spots that make a full trip feel genuinely affordable, starting with the crucial airfare component. Remember, \"cheap\" is relative and can fluctuate wildly based on your departure city, the time of year you travel, and how far in advance you book. But some places just consistently pop up in the \"deal\" alerts more often than others.\n\nSo, without further ado, let's embark on our virtual world tour to discover some of the champions of affordable air travel destinations.\n\n### Iberian Charms and Mediterranean Dreams Accessible from Afar\n\nPicture charming cobblestone streets, sun-drenched beaches, incredible historical sites, and food that makes your taste buds sing ‚Äì all within reach! For many travelers, especially those coming from North America or other parts of Europe, some corners of Southern Europe consistently appear on the radar for relatively inexpensive flights. It's not guaranteed feather-light pricing every single day, but compared to flying into, say, Scandinavia or Switzerland, the difference can be striking. This affordability is often due to massive tourist infrastructure, numerous competing airlines (including a strong low-cost carrier presence), and major international airports handling huge volumes of passengers.\n\n### Portugal: The Atlantic Gem with Surprisingly Attainable Airfares\n\nAh, Portugal! This elongated country perched on the western edge of Europe offers everything from the vibrant city life of Lisbon and Porto to the stunning beaches of the Algarve and the rugged beauty of its Atlantic coast. It's a country steeped in history, rich in culture, and famous for its delicious pastries (Past√©is de Nata, anyone?). What makes Portugal a frequent contender in the list of **countries with the cheapest flights**, particularly from North America and within Europe? Several factors combine beautifully here. Lisbon and Porto are major European hubs, attracting numerous legacy carriers and, crucially, a plethora of budget airlines like Ryanair, EasyJet, and Wizz Air. The competition on routes to these cities is fierce! Furthermore, Portugal has actively courted tourism, which helps maintain a consistent flow of flights. The fact that the cost of living and travel *within* Portugal is also quite reasonable makes it a perennial favorite for budget-conscious travelers. Flying into Lisbon (LIS) or Porto (OPO) can often yield incredible deals, especially if you're flexible with your dates and perhaps willing to connect through another major European city served by budget carriers. It's like finding a golden ticket to affordable European exploration!\n\n### Spain: Donde el Viento (y los Vuelos) Son Baratos\n\nJust next door to Portugal, Spain is another powerhouse when it comes to attracting visitors and, happily for us, often offers very competitive flight prices. Spain is massive and incredibly diverse, from the bustling metropolises of Madrid and Barcelona to the historical depths of Andalusia, the sunny costas, and the islands. Like Portugal, Spain benefits immensely from being a major European travel hub. Madrid (MAD) and Barcelona (BCN) are gigantic international airports serving routes from all over the world. The presence of countless airlines, including budget giants, creating intense competition, is a primary driver for lower fares. Spain's immense popularity as a tourist destination ensures a constant supply of flights, and where there's high volume and high competition, prices tend to drop. Additionally, flying into other major Spanish airports like Malaga (AGP) on the Costa del Sol, Valencia (VLC), or even island airports like Palma de Mallorca (PMI) can also present cheap options, particularly during the shoulder seasons when the weather is still fantastic but the peak summer crowds (and prices!) have subsided. Thinking about exploring Spain? Searching flights here first is usually a smart move.\n\n### Beyond the Iberian Peninsula: Other European Gateways\n\nWhile Portugal and Spain are top contenders, other European countries frequently offer great flight deals, often depending on your departure point. Countries in Central and Eastern Europe like Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria, served extensively by budget airlines from Western Europe, can be incredibly cheap to fly into if you're already on the continent or find a good deal to a major Western European hub first. Even flying into major Western European cities like Dublin (DUB) or sometimes even Paris (CDG/ORY) and Amsterdam (AMS) can yield good prices during sales or off-season, especially if these are hubs for airlines flying from your origin. The key takeaway for Europe? Focus on major airport hubs and countries heavily serviced by budget airlines, particularly outside the high summer season.\n\n### Crossing the Atlantic Affordably: Latin American Wonders\n\nMoving away from Europe, Latin America offers incredible travel experiences, from ancient ruins and vibrant cultures to stunning natural landscapes and lively cities. While flight distances can be significant depending on your origin (especially from Europe or Asia), certain Latin American **countries with the cheapest flights** consistently pop up for travelers, particularly those coming from North America due to proximity and strong route competition. The growth of budget carriers *within* Latin America and increased direct routes have also helped make travel to and around the region more accessible.\n\n### Colombia: The Resilient Gem Finding Its Tourism Groove\n\nLong misunderstood, Colombia has burst onto the global tourism scene, captivating visitors with its diverse landscapes ‚Äì from Caribbean coasts and Andean peaks to Amazon rainforest and bustling, modern cities like Bogota and Medellin. And happily for travelers, flights to Colombia, especially from the US, have become remarkably competitive. Why? Several factors are aligning. Increased safety and positive international perception have led to a surge in demand. In response, more airlines, including US carriers and improving Colombian airlines, are adding routes and increasing capacity. Bogota (BOG) is a major South American hub, attracting flights from all over. Cities like Medellin (MDE) and Cartagena (CTG) are also well-served, particularly from the US and other parts of Latin America. Competition keeps prices in check. Plus, once you're in Colombia, the cost of travel, accommodation, and food is generally very budget-friendly, making the overall trip a financial win. It's a country that offers incredible value, starting from your flight in.\n\n### Mexico: North America's Accessible Neighbor\n\nOkay, maybe calling Mexico a \"Latin American wonder\" when it borders the US feels a bit obvious, but its accessibility and the sheer volume of flights make it *the* prime example of a country with consistently cheap flight options, especially from North America. Whether you're flying to Cancun (CUN) for the beaches, Mexico City (MEX) for historical and cultural immersion, or destinations like Puerto Vallarta (PVR) or Guadalajara (GDL), you can almost always find a deal. The reasons are straightforward: geographical proximity to a massive travel market (the US and Canada), huge demand for both tourism and business travel, and an absolute ton of competing airlines flying countless routes. Legacy carriers, budget airlines, and even charter flights saturate the market. You can often find round trip flights to Mexico for prices comparable to or even less than domestic travel within the US! While some tourist hotspots can be pricey, it's entirely possible to travel Mexico very affordably once you're there. It truly is one of the **countries with the cheapest flights** for a significant chunk of the world population.\n\n### The Lure of the Tropics on a Tight Budget: Caribbean and Central American Options\n\nLooking for sun, sand, and turquoise water without the eye-watering flight cost often associated with tropical paradises? While many Caribbean islands can be prohibitively expensive to fly to, a few exceptions and clever travel strategies can unlock more affordable access. Similarly, certain Central American countries offer budget-friendly entry points.\n\n### Curacao &amp; Limited-Time Dominican Republic Sales: Glitches in the Tropical Matrix?\n\nOkay, Curacao might seem like a curveball. This Dutch Caribbean island often flies under the radar compared to its neighbors like Aruba or Bonaire. While not *always* cheap, flights to Curacao (CUR), particularly from the Eastern US and certain European cities (due to its Dutch connection), *sometimes* see significant price drops fueled by specific airline strategies or less consistent demand than the major hotspots. It's worth keeping an eye on for unexpected deals. Similarly, while not a guaranteed cheap flight country year-round, the Dominican Republic often sees airlines launching big promotions or adding capacity, resulting in temporary but significant drops in fares to destinations like Punta Cana (PUJ) or Santo Domingo (SDQ). These are less about consistent structural cheapness and more about seizing opportunities when they arise. It pays to set fare alerts!\n\nLSI Keywords: \"Caribbean budget travel,\" \"affordable tropical destinations.\"\n\n### Central America: Costa Rica's Accessible Gateway\n\nWhile Costa Rica can be more expensive *on the ground* than its Central American neighbors, flights into its main international airport in San Jose (SJO) or sometimes Liberia (LIR) in the north are often quite competitive, especially from the US. Costa Rica's immense popularity for eco-tourism drives demand, and several major airlines compete for routes. While deals aren't *always* rock bottom, finding a reasonably priced flight to San Jose is usually far easier than flying to some smaller Central American countries or less-serviced routes. From San Jose, overland travel within Costa Rica and to neighboring countries is relatively straightforward, making it a good entry point for Central American adventures.\n\n### The Enigmatic East: Affordable Adventures in Asia\n\nAsia is vast and incredibly diverse, offering everything from bustling megacities and ancient temples to stunning natural landscapes and pristine beaches. For travelers from Europe, North America, or Oceania, the flight distance can be significant, which usually translates to higher prices. However, even with the mileage, certain Asian countries frequently feature in discussions about **countries with the cheapest flights**, often due to being major international hubs, having strong domestic and regional budget airline networks, and offering incredible value once you arrive. The growth of Asian airlines and increased competition on long-haul routes are slowly but surely making these distant dreams more attainable.\n\n### Vietnam: Southeast Asia's Budget Superstar\n\nVietnam is consistently high on the list of affordable travel destinations, and while the long-haul flight isn't always dirt cheap, it's often *more* competitive to fly here than to some of its Southeast Asian neighbors, and the value you get on the ground is phenomenal. Hanoi (HAN) and Ho Chi Minh City (SGN) are Vietnam's two major international gateways. They attract a growing number of airlines from Europe, North America (often with connections), and especially from within Asia. The competition from regional carriers within Asia (AirAsia, VietJet Air, etc.) means that once you're *in* Asia, flying *into* Vietnam or from Vietnam to other countries can be incredibly cheap. The rapid development of its tourism sector and infrastructure also contributes to increased flight options. If you find a good deal getting *to* Asia, flying into either Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City and exploring from there is a classic budget traveler move. It's exotic, fascinating, and remarkably affordable once you factor in the cost once you land.\n\n### Thailand: The Perennial Favorite with High Volume Flights\n\nThailand has been a backpacker and budget traveler haven for decades, and its enduring popularity means there's a massive volume of flights heading there. Like Vietnam, the long-haul flight from distant continents isn't always the absolute cheapest ticket you'll ever buy, but Bangkok (BKK or DMK) is a colossal international hub. It sees flights from virtually everywhere, and the sheer number of airlines competing on these routes, combined with Thailand's massive tourism industry, helps keep fares relatively competitive compared to other long-distance destinations. Furthermore, Bangkok is a major hub for budget airlines flying throughout Southeast Asia. So, if you can snag a decent fare into Bangkok, you have affordable access to Thailand's islands, cities, and northern regions, plus cheap flights to neighboring countries. It's the bedrock of many Southeast Asian travel itineraries for a reason ‚Äì accessibility and value.\n\nLSI Keywords: \"cheap flights to Southeast Asia,\" \"backpacking on a budget,\" \"Asia travel deals.\"\n\n### Other Asian Access Points\n\nOther countries like Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur - KUL is another major budget airline hub) and even parts of India can offer surprisingly cheap flights depending on your origin and the specific airport. India, in particular, has multiple international gateways and significant internal competition, which can sometimes push prices down on routes from major international cities. Always compare prices to multiple airports within a country if possible!\n\n\"Save up to 90% on flights with these amazing deals: https://educdunet.com/\"\n\n### Finding Your Unicorn: Strategies for Snagging the Cheapest Flights\n\nKnowing *which* **countries with the cheapest flights** is a fantastic starting point, but it's only half the battle. You still need to actually *find* those potentially cheap flights amidst the sea of expensive options! Finding truly low fares often requires strategy, flexibility, and a bit of digital savvy. It's less about luck and more about being persistent and using the right tools and tricks. Think of it as a treasure hunt; the treasure is affordable airfare, and your map consists of the tips below.\n\nHere are some battle-tested strategies to help you snag the best possible deals:\n\n1. **Be Flexible with Your Dates:** This is, hands down, the single most important factor in finding cheap flights. Flying on a Tuesday in mid-September is almost always cheaper than flying on a Friday in late July. If you can shift your departure and arrival dates by even a few days, you can potentially save hundreds of dollars. Use flexible date search options on flight comparison websites.\n2. **Be Flexible with Your Destination:** While you have a list of countries often offering cheap flights, being open to *nearby* airports or even slightly different destinations can unlock massive savings. If flying directly to Lisbon is pricey, check Faro or even Seville in Spain (just a bus/train ride away). This is where knowing about **countries with the cheapest flights** *in general* helps ‚Äì you know where to focus your flexible searches.\n3. **Use Flight Comparison Websites (But Check Multiple!):** Sites like Google Flights, Skyscanner, Momondo, and Kayak are invaluable. They aggregate prices from tons of airlines and booking agencies. *However*, no single site always has the absolute best price, and they don't always list *all* airlines (especially some budget carriers). Check at least two or three different sites. Google Flights is fantastic for visualizing prices across a calendar, while Skyscanner and Momondo are great for their \"everywhere\" or \"anywhere\" search functions if you're truly flexible on destination.\n4. **Check Airline Websites Directly:** Once you find a good price on a comparison site, it's *always* smart to go directly to the airline's website to check the price there. Sometimes it's the same, sometimes it's cheaper, and sometimes booking direct makes it easier to handle issues like delays or cancellations. Plus, some budget airlines (like Southwest in the US, or Ryanair sometimes) don't always appear on third-party aggregators.\n5. **Set Fare Alerts:** Found a route you're watching? Set up email alerts on Google Flights or Skyscanner. You'll be notified when the price changes, allowing you to jump on a good deal the moment it appears. It's like having a personal airfare spy!\n6. **Consider Budget Airlines (But Read the Fine Print!):** Budget airlines changed the travel game, making it possible to fly for unbelievably low prices. However, these prices are often just the *basic fare*. Be acutely aware of extra costs for checked baggage, carry-on size limits, seat selection, food, and even printing your boarding pass at the airport. What looks like a ‚Ç¨20 flight can quickly become ‚Ç¨100+ per person round trip if you're not careful. Factor in these potential costs when comparing the initial fare.\n7. **Think About Layovers:** Direct flights are convenient but usually more expensive. Flights with one or more layovers are frequently cheaper. Just make sure the layover time is reasonable (not too short that you miss your connection, not so long it adds an unnecessary day). Sometimes, strategically booking two separate tickets (e.g., flying to a major European hub, then booking a separate budget flight to your final destination) can be cheaper than one through-ticket, but be aware of the risks if your first flight is delayed and you miss your connection (the second airline isn't obligated to help you).\n8. **Fly Mid-Week, Avoid Holidays:** As mentioned earlier, Tuesday and Wednesday are often the cheapest days to fly. Saturday is often the cheapest day to *depart* on international trips that include a weekend. Avoid major holidays like Christmas, New Year's, Easter, and summer peak season if budget is your priority.\n9. **Book at the Right Time (There's No Single Magic Answer, But Trends Exist):** For international flights, many experts suggest booking 2-8 months in advance. Prices can fluctuate wildly within this window. For budget airlines within continents (like within Europe or Asia), booking 1-3 months out is often sufficient, although sales can pop up closer to the date. Use those fare alerts to monitor the sweet spot for your specific route.\n10. **Clear Your Cookies (Sometimes):** While airlines deny it, some travelers believe clearing your browser cookies or searching in incognito/private mode *can* sometimes show lower prices, based on the theory that sites might track your searches and increase prices on routes you check repeatedly. The evidence is mixed, but it doesn't hurt to try!\n11. **Consider Alternate Airports:** Major cities often have more than one airport. Flying into a smaller, secondary airport might be cheaper, though factor in the cost and time of getting from that airport to your final destination. For example, flying into London Stansted (STN) via a budget airline might be cheaper than London Heathrow (LHR), but the train fare into the city center from Stansted is significant.\n\nFollowing these tips increases your chances dramatically of finding great deals to **countries with the cheapest flights** and elsewhere. It takes a little effort, but the savings are absolutely worth it.\n\n### More Than Just the Flight: Considering the Total Trip Cost\n\nWhile finding cheap flights to these countries is a fantastic starting point, remember that the flight cost is just one part of your travel budget. The overall affordability of your trip also depends heavily on the cost of accommodation, food, local transportation, activities, and visas (if required). The good news is that many of the **countries with the cheapest flights** we've discussed also tend to be relatively inexpensive once you're on the ground.\n\n- **Portugal, Spain, Greece, Eastern Europe:** These European destinations offer a range of accommodation from hostels to budget hotels, incredible and affordable local food (think tapas in Spain, street food in Portugal, hearty meals in Eastern Europe), and good public transport networks.\n- **Colombia, Mexico, Much of Central &amp; Southeast Asia (Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, India):** These regions are famous for being backpacking and budget travel havens. You can find incredibly cheap guesthouses or hostels, eat delicious and inexpensive street food or local meals, and utilize affordable buses or trains to get around.\n\nSo, when chasing those cheap flights, feel confident that landing in many of these destinations means the rest of your trip is also likely to be budget-friendly! It's the perfect combination for affordable adventures.\n\n### Putting it all Together: Planning Your Affordable Escapade\n\nOkay, you're armed with knowledge! You know *why* some flights are cheaper, you have a list of **countries with the cheapest flights** to target, and you've got a toolkit of strategies for finding those elusive low fares. What's next? Planning!\n\n1. **Prioritize Flexibility:** Seriously, I can't stress this enough. If you can be flexible with *when* you go and potentially *exactly where* you land, you will find better deals.\n2. **Start Searching Early (But Don't Book Blindly):** Begin monitoring prices for your desired region or one of the cheap flight countries a few months out. Use those fare alerts!\n3. **Compare, Compare, Compare:** Look at different comparison sites, different airlines, and different dates/times. Check alternate airports.\n4. **Read the Fine Print:** Especially with budget airlines, understand all potential extra fees before you click \"book.\"\n5. **Factor in Total Cost:** Remember the on-the-ground costs too. A slightly more expensive flight to a country where everything else is dirt cheap might be better value than a rock-bottom flight to a very expensive destination.\n6. **Be Patient and Persistent:** Finding the best deals can take time and effort. Don't get discouraged!\n\nTraveling the world doesn't have to cost a fortune. By strategically focusing on **countries with the cheapest flights** and employing smart booking strategies, you can make those dream destinations a reality without emptying your savings account. The world is out there waiting, and it's more accessible than you think!\n\n\"Save up to 90% on flights with these amazing deals: https://educdunet.com/\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSo there you have it! The quest for the cheapest flights isn't about finding a hidden portal to Narnia where flights are free. It's about understanding the dynamics of air travel and knowing where to look and when to look. We've explored some incredible **countries with the cheapest flights**, from the sun-drenched coasts of Portugal and Spain to the vibrant cultures of Colombia and Mexico, and the exotic allure of Vietnam and Thailand. These destinations frequently top the lists not just because they're amazing places to visit (which they absolutely are!), but because market forces, competition, and strategic location often make the flight itself less of a barrier than flying to many other parts of the globe. Coupled with smart booking strategies like being flexible, using comparison tools, and understanding budget airlines, you are well-equipped to embark on your next adventure without starting your trip feeling like you've already overspent. Stop dreaming and start planning ‚Äì your affordable flight to an incredible country is out there!",

The carrier‚Äôs route with the longest average delay was London-Gatwick Airport (LGW) to Bengaluru (BLR), with an average delay of one hour and 23 minutes across 50 departures. Services on the route only commenced in August 2024 on a five-times-weekly frequency. The services joined other services flown by the airline from Gatwick to Amritsar, Goa, Kochi, and Ahmedabad.\n\nUK-based industry commentators have been particularly critical of the airline in the past, with poor punctuality being a key driver behind such criticism. However, Air India played down the on-time performance figures when asked for comment by PA Media. A spokesperson for Air India told the news agency, ‚ÄúDuring 2024, Air India‚Äôs flights to and from the UK experienced occasional delays, primarily due to factors beyond our control.\n\n\nAir India on the rise:\n\nIndia‚Äôs Tata Group completed the purchase of national carrier Air India from the Indian government in January 2022. The carrier was sold after falling heavily into debt and suffering from a declining reputation with an aging fleet, punctuality issues, as well as significant competition from other Indian carriers, including the country‚Äôs largest airline, IndiGo. The airline currently operates from three UK airports, comprising Birmingham (BHX), Gatwick, and London-Heathrow (LHR), with routes to several smaller Indian cities, such as those flown to from Gatwick, starting in the post-pandemic era. IndiGo, meanwhile, will start its first flight between India and the UK in July 2025.\n\nThe airline is also undergoing a fleet transformation plan, with hundreds of new Boeing and Airbus aircraft on order, plus a major refurbishment of existing aircraft already underway. While such plans are set to transform the airline over the coming years, there will be no quick fixes for the carrier, and this latest report illustrates that there is still much work to be done in terms of punctuality performance.\n\nBut despite the legacy issues from its time as a state-run carrier, growth remains one of Air India‚Äôs primary tools to shake off the past. Data from aviation analytics company Cirium shows the airline operated 56% more flights from UK airports in 2024 compared with 2019. This figure is expected to rise further during 2025 as the carrier adds more flights and more frequencies. Cirium is expecting to see this figure rise to a 90% increase over 2019 in 2025.\n\nAviation consultant John Strickland told PA Media that there has been ‚Äúa lot of work going on to put the airline back on track‚Äù after it gained a poor reputation for delays and cancellations. ‚ÄúThis was partly caused by a lack of funds to purchase spare parts for aircraft, leading to some of its fleet being grounded,‚Äù Strickland said. ‚ÄúThey are coming out of this period of malaise pre-the Tata takeover and now have to put in work on their engineering, manpower, spare parts holding, all those factors.‚Äù\n\nHe added that some of Air India‚Äôs promotion of its new Airbus A350 first class product has focused on the quality of its service. Yet Stickland cautioned that, ‚ÄúYou can have great meals and a great crew, but fundamentally you‚Äôve got to operate an airline which is as punctual and reliable as possible. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a work in progress for them.‚Äù\n\n\n\nOthers in the top 10:\n\nGuernsey-based carrier Aurigny Air Services had the second-worst punctuality record for UK departures last year, with an average delay of 31 minutes and 12 seconds. The regional airline was followed by Turkish low-cost leisure airline Sun Express with an average of 29 minutes and 36 seconds, and then by TAP Air Portugal with an average delay of 25 minutes and 12 seconds.\n\n\nThe next five positions were taken by American Airlines (25 minutes), TUI (24 minutes 18 seconds), Wizz Air (23 minutes 48 seconds), SWISS (21 minutes 48 seconds), Emirates (21 minutes 36 seconds), with Vueling rounding off the top ten at 21 minutes and 30 seconds.\n\nIrish regional carrier Emerald Airlines (operating as Aer Lingus Regional) recorded the best performance in 2024, with its UK departures delayed by an average of just 10 minutes and 30 seconds.\n\nThe analysis considered all scheduled and chartered departures from UK airports by airlines operating more than 2,500 of these flights last year. Cancelled flights were not included. The average delay for all these airlines was 18 minutes and 18 seconds, down from 20 minutes and 42 seconds in 2023.",

    "text": "Hi all! I thought I'd compile a list of the cheapest flight I've got from my home country of the UK (mostly London) to each continent, barring Antarctica as I'm unlikely to ever get there and cheap flights don't really exist on that route. Some are more impressive than others and sadly some are on routes that aren't around anymore, but I'm always looking to get better deals! Starting with my home continent of Europe:\n\n* **Europe** \\- ¬£1.79 from London to Tirana in Albania, January 2022. This was a mad Wizz Air sale just before Christmas 2021 that reduced many routes to that price, and the way back was the same so I paid ¬£3.58 return! If you count that as a 'pandemic special', outside of Covid it was ¬£2 from London to Bremen, Germany in November 2016 on Ryanair, a similar special sale day. All of these included all taxes/fees and I didn't need to purchase any seats or checked baggage, so that really was the full price.\n* **Africa** \\- ¬£11.62 from London to Marrakesh in Morocco, December 2023. Wizz Air again with their Discount Club, ¬£23.24 return. It wasn't too long after the earthquake so the flights were \\*extremely\\* quiet, especially the way back which probably only had a couple dozen of us on the plane.\n* **Asia** \\- This depends on if you include transcontinental countries, in which case ¬£15.49 from London to Kutaisi, Georgia, in October 2018. Otherwise ¬£17.99 to Istanbul in Turkey (June 2024), or ¬£24.98 to Amman, Jordan (January 2019) transiting through Paphos in Cyprus. Mostly Wizz Air again with Jordan being Ryanair, I'm not sure if it still is but Paphos used to be a brilliant place to transit to the Middle East in the late 2010s, you could get to Israel, Jordan and Lebanon from there pretty easily.\n* **North America** \\- ¬£64.90 from Edinburgh to Hartford, CT in August 2017. This was \\*incredible\\* and a very short lived route from Norwegian Air when they still flew to the United States. Even including getting to Edinburgh from London and then from Hartford to New York City, I managed to get from my London flat to the centre of Times Square for about ¬£93. Never got anywhere near that since!\n* **South America** \\- ¬£213.48 each way from London to Salvador, Brazil, February 2019. Air Europa flight with a transit in Madrid, as of now my only trip to South America, but I remember my friends still calling that a good deal, especially during carnival season.\n* **Australia:** ¬£296.13 each way from London to Sydney with a stopover in Vietnam, September 2017. There were deals even better than this in early 2020 that transited via China, but before I could think about buying any the news coming out of Wuhan around that time put an end to that.\n\nIf there's any way of beating any of these, or you have any better deals you've got over the years, let me know!",

      "Interesting list ! Wizz Air really opened up Europe for me too.\n\nmy own would be:\n\nEurope - Milan with Wizz Air ¬£4.99. was also ¬£4.99 return. Insane to be able to fly to Milan RETURN for cheaper than my train ticket from home to London Gatwick (¬£12) (March 2022)\n\nAfrica - Tangier with Air Arabia for ¬£29 (May 2024)\n\nAsia - Amman with Wizz Air for ¬£26.99 (Jan 2024)  \nThough, going further into Asia next year I've concocted an itinerary flying exclusively Wizz Air flights from Gatwick to Almaty in Kazakhstan (!!) via Cyprus, Armenia and Abu Dhabi. Will be a great adventure and all for less than ¬£100 lol. I'm flying back the easy way with a BA points redemption lol.\n\nNorth America - JFK for ¬£169, but more importantly the return leg was ¬£54 !!!! This was with Norse Atlantic before they started to include hand luggage with fares in January this year. Have never seen anything as low since and with their new fare structure, will likely never again.  \nAlso of note is a TAP Air Portugal trip I booked which incldued a whole day stopover in Porto on the way to EWR and a whole day stopover in Lisbon on the way back. ¬£270 total which I think is great value for a 3 city trip. (Feb 2024).\n\nSouth America - Bogota for ¬£540 with Avianca. Not as impressive as the others lol.",

You‚Äôre lucky to get a Ryanair flight under ¬£20 now.\n\nhttps://www.moneysavingexpert.com/news/2009/09/urgent-ryanair-launches-two-day-1p-/"

    "title": "Bellroy Transit Workpack 20L Second Edition ‚Äì Travel Review",
    "text": "I recently took the **Transit Workpack 20L (Second Edition)** on a trip to the UK and decided to push the limits by doing some backpack-only travel to nearby countries on budget airlines like Ryanair. After several flights and long days on foot, I‚Äôve formed some solid opinions on this pack ‚Äî both good and bad.\n\n[Transit Workpack 20L](https://preview.redd.it/jyarplm4ma3f1.jpg?width=1755&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d07eae8588b122c103d36f1026bfb293e9230d8f)\n\n# ‚úàÔ∏è Budget Airline Friendly!\n\nFirst off, Bellroy‚Äôs listed dimensions are straight up inaccurate. Their site claims the bag is **51 x 38 x 16 cm**, which is way off. I personally measured it at **43 x 17 x 28 cm.**\n\nDespite the bag being a bit bigger than Ryan air's \"small bag\" allowance of 40 x 20 x 25 cm, I had no issues bringing it onboard. I even tested it in one of their size checkers ‚Äî it can squish down to fit. Prior to this trip, I had been considering a dedicated travel bag, but anything larger definitely wouldn‚Äôt have passed as a free personal item on Ryanair. Wizz Air and EasyJet have slightly more lenient bag dimension restrictions, so if it works for Ryanair, it'll work for most.\n\n[On a Wizz Air size checker. \\(Sorry, forgot to take a picture for Ryan air\\)](https://preview.redd.it/vlnxjwy6ma3f1.jpg?width=987&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da2ccefde5705437a99c155d1064f84369f9fae8)\n\n# üéí Packing Efficiency and Space\n\nConsidering the tech kit intrusion at the top, you‚Äôve got about 30 cm of unobstructed vertical space in the main compartment ‚Äî perfect for a medium packing cube. On one leg of the trip, I packed:\n\n* 10 pairs of socks & underwear\n* 5 shirts\n* 3 pants\n\n‚Ä¶with no issues. The bag performs impressively for its size, not to mention, the clamshell opening is a godsend.\n\nThe tech kit compartment although eating into the main compartment, is well-placed for quick access to cables, a charger, or small essentials. Super handy in airports or during short work sessions.\n\n[Don't judge me for the Tim Tams.](https://preview.redd.it/kj34i3v5ma3f1.jpg?width=987&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b6342c99ed566cd47689a40b789f0febfa9d9871)\n\n# üíª Issues with Overpacking\n\nWhen fully packed, getting a laptop in or out becomes a chore. The laptop sleeve shares space with the main compartment, so the moment you overload the bag, the sleeve tightens up. If you have a small 13\" laptop like me, the laptop will sit quite deeply into the bag too, making retrieval rather cumbersome.\n\nThe front compartment also becomes practically unusable when the main compartment is stuffed ‚Äî anything thicker than a pen won‚Äôt fit. And forget using the water bottle holder ‚Äî it collapses into the bag.\n\n# üí™ Comfort & Padding\n\nEven though the padding isn‚Äôt a breathable mesh, it held up fine under heavier travel loads. There were a few moments I wished I had a hip belt, but that‚Äôs more a reflection of me pushing this work-oriented backpack into travel mode.\n\nWhen used as intended ‚Äî a workpack ‚Äî most of these problems vanish:\n\n* The bottle holder works well for a 500ml bottle or even a Blunt Metro umbrella.\n* The shoulder straps are decently padded and comfortable.\n* Laptop access becomes easy.\n\nI also wanted to mention that I absolutely love the materials and color choices. The exterior feels rugged, and the interior materials feel nice and premium.\n\n# üß≥ Baggage Passthrough & Handling\n\nThe luggage passthrough is a welcome addition and works well. That said, it often doesn‚Äôt fully retract on mine ‚Äî it gets stuck on the socket and hangs out loosely until I fix it.\n\nThe lack of a side handle makes removing the bag from a roller suitcase a little awkward, but it‚Äôs manageable. Despite the sideways orientation, it didn‚Äôt bother me as much as I thought it would. Still, I would‚Äôve preferred if the bag sat upright on a roller luggage.\n\n[Luggage strap not always fully retracting.](https://preview.redd.it/7eexuf78ma3f1.jpg?width=1755&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c33fdd604f36caad49862f71331ae32c884a865a)\n\n# üñê Top Grab Handle\n\nIn Nomad Nation‚Äôs review, he noted that the top grab handle was flush and could be hard to grab. I had the same reaction initially, but I quickly got used to it ‚Äî a non-issue.\n\n# ‚úÖ Final Verdict\n\nThe Transit Workpack 20L Second Edition is a solid hybrid bag. If you‚Äôre looking for a minimalist work bag that can pass as a small travel bag, it‚Äôs a great option ‚Äî especially if you plan on flying on European budget airlines. It‚Äôs not perfect, but its compact dimensions, structured shape, and sleek look make it a strong contender for short trips and daily carry.",

(article 6, 1.a) \n\n\nTo me it looks like they are stating so because most people won‚Äôt challenge it. Unless there is a caveat to this regulation, which is did not see, but I am not a legal professional, hence my question.\n\nI flew from London to Budapest, my flight landed 2h38 later than scheduled landing time.

      "Firstly, compensation is only due if the cause of the delay is something the airline has control over. If it‚Äôs because of something the airline can‚Äôt control (such as airport strikes, weather, etc), no compo due.\n\nIf your delay reason makes you eligible for compensation, compensation only kicks in when you arrive at your destination 3+ hours late.\n\nFor a flight <1500km, at 2+ hours of delay on departure, you are entitled to meals & refreshments and 2 phone calls/emails/faxes. For a flight >1500km, this threshold is upped to 3+ hours of departure delay.\n\nTo summarise:\nCOMPENSATION = 3+ hours delay on ARRIVAL;\nASSISTANCE = 2+ hours delay on DEPARTURE\n\nIf you‚Äôre after compensation for your delayed arrival, even if you had an eligible cause of delay, your delay was less than 3 hours so you‚Äôre not entitled to anything.",
      "EU261/2004 provides compensation in case of a delay of at least 3 hours, there is unfortunately just some meal vouchers provided at most airlines in case of more than 2, but less than 3h delay",
      "Regulation says 3 hours. What you found must be an old version or something. I can tell you from experience that when there‚Äôs a delay, the airline will do everything possible to keep it under 3 hours, so something like 2h40-2h50 is common.",

    "text": "Hi all,\n\nI'm considering booking a round trip from Belgrade (BEG) to Palermo (PMO) via Rome Fiumicino (FCO) through Kiwi.com. The flights involve self-transfer (Wizz Air + Ryanair on the way there, and Ryanair + Wizz Air on the way back).\n\nOutbound (5 Sep 2025):\n\n*  BEG ‚Üí FCO (Wizz Air) arrives at 18:00\n*  FCO ‚Üí PMO (Ryanair) departs at 19:25     \n*  Time to transfer: 1h25\n\nReturn (12 Sep 2025):\n\n* PMO ‚Üí FCO (Ryanair) arrives at 17:25\n* FCO ‚Üí BEG (Wizz Air) departs at 18:30\n* Time to transfer: 1h05\n\n[Kiwi.com](http://Kiwi.com) claims this is enough time and includes their \"transfer protection\", but since it's a self-transfer and these are two different low-cost airlines (likely different terminals too), I'm nervous about the short connection windows.\n\nHas anyone done a self-transfer at FCO recently, especially between Wizz and Ryanair? Is it realistic to make these connections if the first flight is even slightly delayed?\n\nAny advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance üôè",

      "I have never done a Wizz-Ryanair transfer in FCO, but I think it's doable without too much sweat... FCO is quite good for transfers... At the end it all depends if the inbound flight is on time or not and that most of the time does not depend on the airport.\n\nI would look at the statistics of % of on time arrival for the two inbound routes... (I'm sure you can find it online).",

Don‚Äôt Trust the Label‚ÄîCheck the Actual Size**  \nLots of bags say ‚Äúcarry-on approved‚Äù but are over the airline limit once packed. Especially with Ryanair and EasyJet, you‚Äôll want to stay right at or under 45 x 36 x 20 cm. I usually test mine at home using a cardboard box cut to size; cheap but effective.\n\n**2. Pack According to Your Style**\n\n* Light packer? Go for 12‚Äì15L slim backpacks. They‚Äôll slide under the seat and keep you fast and mobile.\n* Weekend break? Try 18‚Äì25L with compression zips or expandability, but be careful not to overpack.\n\n**3. Hard Shell vs. Soft Shell**  \nIn my experience:\n\n* **Hard shells** (polycarbonate is best) protect your stuff better and resist water, but they're bulkier.\n* **Soft shells** are more forgiving and often weigh less. They also have more usable pockets.\n\nI lean toward soft shells for short trips unless I‚Äôm carrying fragile items.\n\n**4. Spinner vs. 2 Wheels**  \nIf you‚Äôre mainly in airports, 4-wheel spinner hard shells are great. But if you're dealing with cobblestones or trains, 2-wheel rollerboards are more stable. For soft shell backpacks, I prefer ones with thick, padded straps and back support. You‚Äôll feel every ounce after 15 minutes.\n\n**5. Interior Layout Matters**  \nHard shells usually split 50/50 like a clamshell. Great for packing cubes but a pain in small hotel rooms. Soft shells usually have a single deep compartment (bucket style), which I find easier when you're packing fast or living out of the bag.\n\n# Bonus Tips\n\n* **Water resistance:** UK weather is chaos. Look for bags with treated zippers and rain-resistant fabric.\n* **Organization:** Mesh dividers, laptop sleeves, and external pockets save you at security checks.\n* **Eco-conscious picks:** Some brands now use recycled PET bottles or nylon, good for the planet, still tough.",

    "title": "Trip Report: Transnistria (Moldova) in January 2025",
    "text": "When travelling in Eastern Europe and, more specifically, countries that once formed part of the USSR, it can understandably be a pejorative to describe somewhere as \"Soviet\", \"like going back in time\", or (even worse) \"Russian\". However, travelling to Moldova's breakaway republic known as Transnistria in English or Pridniestrovia locally, where this description is not only accurate but perhaps welcomed by locals. \n\nIf you're a history buff like myself, you may have heard of Transnistria but for most travellers and tourists alike - Moldova, let alone Transnistria, is unlikely to have ever come across your radar. \n\nTransnistria's history is complicated so I'll try to explain it as briefly and easily as possible. Moldova used to be part of Romania prior to World War II and the area that is now Transnistria was part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Following the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the area of Moldova was given to the USSR, which became the Moldovan SSR. The area of Transnistria was changed from the Ukrainian SSR to the Moldovan SSR, which wasn't an issue until 1990 when the Soviet Union fell, leading to a civil war in Moldova. \n\nToday, Transnistria is a quasi, semi-recognised, state of its own that operates with its own currency and border, although it is evident it has aspirations to join the Russian Federation. Its people speak Russian, are ethnically Russian, and look towards a future with Russia. Russia operates a number of military bases in the area, there for so-called \"peace-keeping\" missions, although the Moldovan government has some opinions on this I'm sure. \n\nTransnistria isn't even recognised as a state by Russia. It only receives recognition from other quasi-state breakaway regions backed by the Russian Federation - these are the two breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossettia, internationally recognised as sovereign parts of Georgia. \n\nMy journey to Transnistria involved a return to Chisinau, Moldova - a place I had been to on my Eastern European travels in 2019, where I spent six weeks travelling from Vienna to Istanbul, the long way round. That time, I spent three nights in Chisinau, resting and recuperating after an arduous journey from Lviv to Odessa, followed by a failed hitchhiking attempt from Odessa to Moldova. I remember at the time not having the energy to do too much travelling within Moldova itself so I spent the time in the city centre, exploring the parks, eating the food, and primarily relaxing before the next left of the trip up to Kiev, Kharkiv, and then down to Georgia.\n\nWhen I returned in January of this year (2025), my plan was to:\n\n * head to Transnistria for the first time and,\n * to explore another lesser-known autonomous region with Moldova, Gagauzia. \n\nIt would be a quick trip, just two nights, with a lot of exploring, but with a career that I enjoy comes certain restrictions on my annual leave and also in my days off! Nevertheless, what I had planned was do-able in the time I had given myself. \n\nI arrived into Chisinau on a Wizz Air flight from London, late in the evening on the 30th January and went straight to my hotel, The Hotel Jumbo, which I must recommend. For a fee, they picked me up from the airport and took me straight to the hotel. My room was huge and I enjoyed a nice hot bath before retiring to bed - quite the change from the last time I was here and stayed in a bunk bed in an 8-person dorm for ¬£10/night with a crazy Australian who yelled at people for opening their phones in the dark (the guy was genuinely mad). \n\nIt was an early start the following day and back to my backpacker ways. I joined the early morning commuters on Chisinau's bus network, like sardines in a can as a man with a blue high-viz squeezed his way through the bus, collecting the 6 Moldovan Lei fare, paid in cash only, quite the difference from other European capitals where tickets can be paid on your phone, with a contactless card, but most certainly not cash!\n\nA few stops into the city centre and I arrived near the city's central bus station, nestled in the central market where the vendors were getting their stalls set up for the day. I dropped my bag off in an underground bag storage place, much to the bemusement of the lady working there. Moldova is supposedly Europe's least visited country and I suppose they don't get tourists too much. Thinking back to it - I don't think I remember hearing or seeing any other English-speaking tourists while I was there. \n\nAfter a couple of laps of the bus station, I managed to find the bus stand where the bus to Tiraspol, Transnistria's capital, would be leaving. A friendly bus driver asked where I was going, and pointed me in the bus. It was all going smoothly so far. \n\nI was filled with trepidation on the journey - Transnistria is marked as a \"do not travel\" zone according to the UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Not that it has ever stopped me before when travelling to Iraq, Syria, and parts of Armenia. Nevertheless, warnings of kidnapping, false imprisonment, and more always create increasingly more vivid details and imagery in your head as you get closer to the border. \n\nMoldova, of course, does not recognise Transnistria's independence and as such has no formal border checks as you leave their area of control. The Transnistrian 'border' was a relative formality. The border guard who dealt with my passport seemingly disgusted at my ineptitude to speak Russian, although he spoke English quite well. I was given a slip of paper which doubled as my 'tourist visa' and back into the bus I went. \n\nThe difference between Moldova and Transnistria was extremely noticeable. Even when disregarding the Russian military bases, Russian flags, Russian soldiers, and destroyed tanks from the civil war that took place here in the early 1990s, it truly is like stepping back into the Soviet Union. While the buses in Moldova have not changed in 20 years, the buses in Transnistria have not changed in 40 years. Perhaps due to international sanctions or perhaps due to public officials embezzlement, not a lot of money seems to trickle down into public services. \n\nI'm the last to get off the bus in Tiraspol's city centre. One main high street forms the centre here. I walked to \"Victory Park\", a common name in former Soviet states - the park is overgrown and a rusty theme park litters the view, although it is the same park used as a thumbnail in a number of Youtube videos. If I didn't know any better, I'd have thought I was in Chernobyl. \n\nOn the way back into town I walk past Transnistria's official government building. A bust of Vladimir Lenin looks proudly into the distance, with the brutalist government institution behind it proudly draped in the flag of the People's Republic of Transnistria. To the left is a huge notice board with the mugshots of the republic's most loyal civil servants no doubt. It's when I notice on the second row of people's mugshots that the border guard who allowed me into Transnistria was actually Commissar for Border Security, or something along those lines. How bizarre, but quite cool too. \n\nTiraspol's city centre is relatively small and, admittedly, quite boring. What makes Transnistria interesting is its history and uniqueness. In the main square are a few flags, one obviously being their own, the other being that of the Russian Federation, and the other two being that of South Ossettia and Abkhazia, a small nod of appreciation for their recognition of the area. I wonder if South Ossettia and Abkhazia have Trasnistrian flags? \n\nI grab a couple of souvenirs and head into the town of Bender, one of the few areas west of the Dniester River that the Transnistrian government holds. I want to see Bender fortress but the weather is terribly cold and by this time I'm quite bored of the place! There is very little tourist infrastructure here. I am beyond starving and look for the USSR Cafe, one of the very few tourist traps here but after walking in circles of where it said it was on the map and probably drawing the attention of the KGB, I give up my hopes of finding this place and go to the bus station to return to civili... I mean Moldova. \n\nIs it worth visiting Transnistria? I'd say if you are interested in Eastern Europe, former Soviet states, and unique places - then definitely yes. For the normal traveller there is really not a lot there to do. Even I, a self-proclaimed history buff and enthusiast of visiting places lesser-known, found Transnistria quite boring.",

      "Theoretically yes, practically depends on the gate agent mood. On their website, for carry on they have a backpack image, and they have a trolley image only for priority passengers. I had the same question as you and back in 2022 I used a trolley with the respective dimensions and on the first leg of the flight I had no issues, while on return flight the gate agent asked if I had priority and wanted to charge for the bag. I told her that is in their dimensions and I was lucky that the second gate agent told the first one is ok, specially that the flight was delayed and everyone was nervous.",
      "It all comes down to the gate agents, I have seen so many times people with carry-on trolley boarding but not having priority boarding, the worst is when they have also a backpack and then the flight is full. The best advice is to queue up so you'll not be late in the aircraft.",

      "I just want to understand the rationale behind having five (!!!) destinations to Italy.",
      "As far as I know they have 4 aircrafts based in Kutaisi. Now for Yerevan it's not yet clear if they'll also operate the current routes from the base or not. I'm guessing they'll first add 1/2 aircraft here and then gradually expand. Right now Kutaisi is not much bigger than Yerevan. Wizz has approximately 1 million seats from here and probably around a million and half from Kutaisi.",
      "Well, Germany will have a whopping 7 routes from Yerevan. Also Italy is very popular right now with local travellers, I know some people who visit Italy several times a year just for fun. This will increase tourism numbers by a big margin, if you compare visitor data from counties from where Wizz opened routes, you'll see the clear difference. Now there are much more Bulgarian citizens visiting than before or less Lithuanians because of Vilnius suspension."

    "text": "I recently experienced a denied boarding situation with Wizz Air. My flight to Lisbon was overbooked, and we weren't able to board the plane. After completing a claim form for compensation, received a response from WizzAir stating that they will not reimburse the hotel costs, as they consider these to be indirect expenses.\n\nHowever, when I spoke with the staff at the airport, they mentioned that these costs should indeed be reimbursed. The issue is that I had an Airbnb booking in Lisbon for the nights, which I lost because I couldn‚Äôt board the flight.\n\nIs it normal for Wizz Air to refuse reimbursement for accommodation costs in cases of denied boarding, even when it‚Äôs a pre-booked accommodation like Airbnb? Has anyone had a similar experience with them?",

    "text": "Aviation expert Jeff Wise has raised concerns about the potential for Russian cyber and electronic warfare tactics to disrupt Western aviation systems. He warns that methods such as GPS jamming, spoofing, and interference with aircraft collision avoidance systems (like TCAS) could be employed as part of a broader strategy of hybrid warfare.\n\nWhile his claims remain speculative, Wise references past incidents such as the downing of MH17 and the disappearance of MH370 to illustrate the potential for aviation to become a target in geopolitical conflict. Though not all experts agree with these interpretations, they have reignited conversations about the security and resilience of critical aviation infrastructure.\n\nRecent reports have highlighted a significant increase in GPS spoofing incidents, with a 500% surge noted in 2024, particularly in regions like the Baltic and Eastern Europe . These disruptions have affected thousands of flights, including those operated by major carriers such as Ryanair and Wizz Air . Additionally, the Baltic states have warned of the risk of aviation catastrophes due to Russian GPS jamming activities .\n\nWe believe this raises important questions about aviation security and the preparedness of Western systems to counter such threats. Whether or not these scenarios materialize, they highlight the growing intersection of geopolitics and technology in civil aviation.\n\nWe‚Äôre curious to hear the community‚Äôs thoughts:\n\t‚Ä¢\tHow real is the threat of GPS and avionics manipulation in modern airspace?\n\t‚Ä¢\tWhat safeguards are currently in place, and are they sufficient?\n\t‚Ä¢\tAre there recent examples or drills in Western aviation that address these threats directly?\n\nLet‚Äôs discuss\n\nOur Sources:\n\nhttps://ops.group/dashboard/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GPS-Spoofing-Final-Report-OPSGROUP-WG-OG24.pdf\n\nhttps://flyapg.com/blog/opsgroup-report-naviguard-recommendation\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/apr/22/thousands-of-flights-to-and-from-europe-affected-by-suspected-russian-jamming\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/gps-jamming-is-screwing-with-norwegian-planes\n\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/37776b16-0b92-4a23-9f90-199d45d955c3\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/what-is-gps-jamming-why-it-is-problem-aviation-2024-04-30\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/what-is-gps-jamming-why-it-is-problem-aviation-2024-04-30",

However, it appears the rules have changed and they let us take 1x5L Zamzam each alhamdulillah.\n\nWe travelled everywhere by taxi.

We also had a quote after negotiating for 350 SAR but I didn't fully trust the driver.\n\nWhen shopping, always negotiate and start walking away to see the prices plummet (especially Madinah). We didn't buy anything from clock tower and instead went to Safa tower nearby. Madinah appeared cheaper than Makkah.\n\nWe stayed at Anjum Hotel in Makkah which was amazing and very close to the expansion (but 15min walk to the Kaaba). We stayed at Mysk Hotel for Madinah, but I would recommend staying north of the Masjid to make it easier for women to enter. \n\nFor our second Umrah, we went to Masjid Aisha straight after Maghrib and ended up doing Tawaf straight after Isha - I would definitely recommend this as it felt a lot more peaceful and we were able to do everything we wanted.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need any numbers.",

If you are travelling solo, then maybe wizz air will give you a middle seat on purpose, but when travelling in a group (2 or more), wizz air will try seperate you and your companions in a way where all of you are sat next to two booked seats. For example, 22A but B and C is allready booked. They do this so once you get your ticket, you will book two new seats to sit next to each other, instead of changing one of to sit next to your friend in the middle seat. For example, you get put in 27F, ur friend gets put in 29A, but 27D and E and 29B and C are booked. So now you are forced to pay for two new seats instead of moving 29A to 27E for instance.

      "Ryanair are fine in general, the only thing I find is that on FR aircraft, the seats don't curve around the knees as they do with Wizz. On a short flight this is unlikely to be a problem. I think the longest I've done on a Ryanair aircraft in recent years was Kyiv to London, I'm quite tall, it was fine. It'd probably be ok for the Gatwick-Larnaca and Yerevan-Milan I've recently done on Wizz. Both were just over 4 hours.\n\n  \nThe insurance I find expensive although I don't know a lot about the Romanian travel insurance market in general.",
      "I prefer Wizz airbus planes to Ryanair Boeings, especially the overhead luggage.\n\nInsurance is optional for you to choose, all airlines try to sell it. Depends if you could cope with something going wrong without it.\n\nMake sure you check in on  time online and have the right paperwork or evidence with you.",
      "With regards to service etc Wizz / Ryanair would be in the same budget bucket. \n\nRyanair having scooped up all the Boeing Max 8 planes would push me to fly Wizz if they are flying something different.  \n\nWill still avoid the Maxes after their poor safety regard and boeings coverup.",
      "I haven't set foot in a Ryanair aircraft since December 2009, when they hurriedly closed their BSL base, cancelled all flights and let go all their staff with about two weeks notice in a Michael O'Leary hurt pride hissy fit over airport fees which he demanded be lowered just for him, and when the airport didn't cave in to his demands (why should they) he took it out on his customers and his employees.\n\n Left their passengers stranded - I had several flights bought on them to LON into the new year and had to rebook on BA on short notice which cost a small fortune.  Not a great help to get the CHF 49 ticket refunded if having to pay  490 on another airline that actually flies the day you need to travel.\n\nAlso, their cabin is even tighter than Wizz' which is not surprising as they fly 737s instead of A32x. And they don't offer products like Privilege Pass, so in order to have a decent flying experience with them you are forced to pay stupid amounts for ancillary fees every time you fly.\n\nThe only thing they have going for them is that their IT is managed way better than Wizz', Much less website and app glitches / service outages. \n\n \n\nBuy travel insurance as a standalone product. you can get an annual policy covering multiple trips for the same amount of money you pay for single-trip policy booked through the airline portal.  It's the same with rental car' excess coverage...."

I‚Äôd appreciate hearing from pilots or cadets already in either airline. Your experience could help me a lot.\n\nQuick overview:\n\nRyanair: type rating on 737 (self-sponsored, 30k ‚Ç¨); unclear start date, probably late this year. Higher salary in the long term, bases in Western Europe.\n\nWizz: type rating on A320 with no upfront costs and all expenses paid, start date in the near future. Lower salary, bases mainly in Eastern Europe.\n\nI know many cadets are choosing Wizz simply to avoid taking out a large loan, which I‚Äôd definitely have to do for Ryanair. But I'm trying to understand what would be better in the long term, and your experiences from FOs, cadets from either airline would be helpful.\n\nThanks a lot in advance!",

      "If your baggage is within the size limits you should be fine. In theory. Have heard a few horror stories about people being charged even with bags that fit within the sizer. \n\nYou should always purchase travel insurance for every trip. I very much doubt that you'll get the best or cheapest coverage directly with Ryanair though, shop around for a better deal and keep that entirely separate from your flight purchases.\n\nIt's only worth switching to Wizzair if the tickets are far cheaper, otherwise why bother? \n\nRyanair, Easyjet, Wizzair et al are all much of a muchness really, the flights are cheap enough but literally everything else costs more money. Choose a seat? More money. Want a cup of coffee onboard? More money. And so on. Expect nothing more than a seat and your expectations will be met...",
      "They are basic, but fine in my experience.\n\nThey are strict with cabin baggage etc, so don‚Äôt try to push the envelope.\n\nThe booking process is designed to add extras on at every turn, so you do have to read carefully and decide what you need, particularly whether you need checked baggage.\n\nWhether you wish to buy their bundled travel insurance or someone else‚Äôs is very much up to you.",
      "Ryanair and Wizzair are essentially the same airline with the same crew on both (buzz crew) so stick with Ryanair if it's cheaper and you want those few extra holiday hours. \n\nI wouldn't post extra for the insurance unless you usually buy it for your other holidays, but it might be worth looking at dedicated travel insurance as you'll likely find better coverage that way.",
      "I‚Äôve flown with Ryanair numerous times around Europe and had a good experience. Just pay attention to their website and take your time when you book. \n\nI don‚Äôt take their insurance as we have our own\nI normally take a small carry on rucksack and a small wheel case on board and don‚Äôt check any bags in. Pay attention to sizes as they can & do check\n\nYou‚Äôll get spammed with offers on transfers, car hire , but just delete them\n\nI think they‚Äôre fine",
      "In general you will have no issues with Ryanair if you follow their luggage policy (sizes as well as items allowed in it like max 1 liter of liquids in bottles of 100 ml in handluggage stored in a transparent ziplock bag). \n\nMake sure to make a Ryanair account and log in prior to selecting flights. (I had some issues with their app and website not working properly but I think this is because I logged in at a later point in middle of booking which made the system think its a 3rd party booking or something so I had issues login-in and a travel assistant on app that did not work). If you face such issues you can always chat with a customer support employee online and travel information is always visible on the airport itself.\n\nThe insurance option I never get. Its a 3rd party insurance company and you won't get refunded tickets anyways. If you want to insure yourself for medical costs and lost luggage, contact your own insurance company and get a travel insurance there instead.\n\nWhat I always get is the basic tariff + priority (just so I can bring my 10kg small suitcase on board and check-in well ahead of the flight). I also add a seat of choice but that is personal. If I need more luggage along I also get the 20kg in hold suitcase option.\n\nHaven't had bad experiences at the airports nor in the planes."

      "I've had experience with Wizz Air before. Twice, they cancelled my flight a few days in advance, leaving me to scramble to buy flights from other airlines (at a much higher cost). Not worth the risk at all. It's commonplace for budget airlines to change the time by a bit or a few hours, but to cancel the flight and giving you an alternative flight a few days forward or later? Wizz Air specialty.",
      "Honestly, no, they're not that bad. A shade better than Ryanair, at least.  For shorthaul flights within Europe, they're entirely competent.\n\nBut remember as with all LoCos - you'll only avoid paying extra if you follow the rules (on bag size/weight/etc.) and the price you pay once you've included everything you need may not be as cheap as it first appeared."

The Abu Dhabi flight was fine, but it was only an hour flight from where I live. The Vienna flight was an overnight flight (6 hours) and was a 4 on a scale from 1-10. It‚Äôs bearable, but definitely a clear step down from your average airline. People were moving around constantly throughout the flight. There were lots of families with young kids. (Presumably trying to save a buck). On the return flight from Vienna, there was even a scare that not everyone would get a seat and there was some minor chaos that ensued as people tried to fight to the front of the line to make sure they got on. \n\nWould I fly them again?

Please remember when deciding flying vs planes just because the flight is only 60 min don't forget to add the 2 hours before the flight, the cost of a taxi or train (plus more time) to and from the airport compared to an easy in town trip to a train.

      "> Einen Anhaltspunkt liefert aber der Blick auf die Flugpreise von Strecken mit √§hnlicher Distanz. Wer zum Beispiel an diesem Montag (16. September) f√ºr den 23. September einen Hinflug von Stuttgart nach Kopenhagen buchen will, muss f√ºr die Monopolverbindung der skandinavischen SAS laut Buchungsplattform Opodo 462 Euro bezahlen.\n\n> Ein Flug von Berlin nach Kopenhagen ‚Äì **die Flugdistanz ist mit knapp 800 Kilometern die gleiche** ‚Äì ebenfalls am 23. September und mit SAS ‚Äì kostet hingegen nur 152 Euro. Hier herrscht Wettbewerb. Beim Konkurrenten Norwegian gibt es das Ticket schon f√ºr 88 Euro, Easyjet bef√∂rdert den Fluggast f√ºr 97 Euro.\n\nAlso das m√ºssten sie mal erkl√§ren. Von Stuttgart bis Kopenhagen sind es Luftline 800 km, aber von Berlin nach Kopenhagen sind es nur 350 km.\n\nVielleicht haben sie sich nur vertan und meinten von Berlin nach Oslo (etwas √ºber 800 km) oder so.",
      "Auch eine gute M√∂glichkeit, Klimaschutz zu betreiben. Naja. \nKleine Anekdote: Ich habe letztens nach Fl√ºgen von D√ºsseldorf nach Br√ºnn (Tschechien) geschaut. Es gibt Fl√ºge.

      "Ohne Paywall:\nhttps://archive.is/Ezk38\n*Original auf Handelsblatt erschienen\n\n‚ÄûGrund daf√ºr sind die horrenden Zugangskosten, die von der deutschen Regierung und dem Flughafenmanagement nicht gesenkt werden konnten‚Äú, begr√ºndet das Unternehmen den Teilr√ºckzug. Der britische Rivale Easyjet hat seine in Berlin stationierte Flotte bereits zum Winterflugplan 2022/2023 von 18 auf elf Flugzeuge reduziert. Auch Lufthansa hat das Angebot an vielen deutschen Flugh√§fen verringert.\n\nDie hohen staatlichen Kosten lassen die Gewinne der Fluggesellschaften gerade auf Kurz- und Mittelstrecken abschmelzen. Verbindungen lohnen sich h√§ufig nicht mehr. Dazu kommt: Weil Flugger√§t wegen der Liefer- und Technikprobleme derzeit knapp ist, werden die verf√ºgbaren Jets lieber auf den lukrativen Strecken eingesetzt.\n\nJe nach Flughafen sind die staatlichen Geb√ºhren gegen√ºber dem Vorkrisenjahr 2019 tats√§chlich deutlich gestiegen, teilweise haben sie sich fast verdoppelt. Ein typischer Flug mit einem Airbus A320 kostete zum Beispiel in D√ºsseldorf im Jahr 2019 laut Branchenverband BDL 2227 Euro. Im Mai dieses Jahres musste eine Fluggesellschaft daf√ºr 4390 Euro bezahlen, ein Plus von 97 Prozent.\n\nIn Frankfurt betr√§gt der Zuwachs bei den Geb√ºhren 53 Prozent, in M√ºnchen und Berlin 66 Prozent und in Hamburg 75 Prozent......\n\n..\n\n....‚ÄûDer Luftverkehrsstandort Deutschland f√§llt unter das Niveau des Jahres 2013 zur√ºck. Reisende haben weniger Flugstrecken zur Auswahl als vor zehn Jahren‚Äú, sagt Beisel. Es gebe kein Nachfrage-, sondern ein klares Angebotsproblem. Eine Wettbewerbsgleichheit mit den europ√§ischen Nachbarn k√∂nne nur durch eine signifikante Reduzierung der staatlichen Belastungen gelingen, so Beisel weiter. Und damit auch wieder eine gr√∂√üere Angebotsauswahl f√ºr die Flugg√§ste hierzulande.",

But i have work commitments. With no choice, I have no choice but to book with an alternative (x2) carriers, which will fly me from Sicily to Milan, and Milan to London. This expensive little ditty cost me a further ¬£800. \nOh and at this point, i was staying in hotel number 3.  Total cost of hotels ¬£220. \n\nWizz Air are only available to talk to via a premium phone number (¬£1.45p) per minute.

They aggressive squeeze costs down, but have zero support or care for passengers. \n\nPay a few quid extra, go with anyone else. \n\nI'm over ¬£1k out of pocket and it's looking less and less likely that the insurance company (AIG, equally shit) will not pay, because they state \"Wizz offered alternative flights (unsuitable due to work) and help with accommodation (no they didn't). \n\nSave your sanity.

I think you'd have had problems with any airline.\n\nWhat I would recommend someone in a similar situation would be to buy a train ticket to Naples or Rome and a direct flight ticket from there, and let the airline and insurance reimburse you."

      "WizzAir are‚Ä¶.fine. Ultra low-cost carrier so you pay for everything as expected. They will get you from A-B, usually. Most of the complaints are from people who don‚Äôt read their fee rules and expect 5* service.\n\nThe route network is pretty interesting and vast, this offer will include routes to Dubai and even the Maldives, albeit with connections if coming from Western Europe.\n\nMain downsides to the offer:\n\n- You can only book from 3 days before departure, so very likely during peak times the flight might be full. Also makes booking hotels etc a bit of a risk, but you could always just book flex hotel rates and then cancel if you can‚Äôt get on a flight.\n\n- WizzAir financials aren‚Äôt the best as of late, so if they go bust, you will likely lose out on what you paid.\n\n- No cabin bags beyond a personal item for under your seat, and Wizz are strict af. So you‚Äôd likely need to buy baggage on top of the ‚Ç¨9.99 admin fee per flight.\n\nIf you plan on flying at least 3-4+ in the year, this offer is worthwhile.",
      "In Hungary (and Wizzair is a hungarian airline afterall) the following apply: you will still have to pay 9,99 euros for a flight, you can only book within 72 hours of the flight, and only if there are empty seats left.",
      "Looks a really interesting offer. Have been trying to weigh up the pros and cons to see if it actually is worth it. \n\nI think you need to be a specific type of traveller - i.e. booking last minute (has to be within 72 hours). Quite open to where you go as some flights will be full etc so maybe have to change plans and go to a different destination. \n\nOnly really an option for solo travel as it would be quite a gamble trying to do more than one onto the same flights on separate bookings (less on off peak times I suppose).\n\nThe aim for sure would be can you get to the Maldives with just your cabin bag! \n\nWizz air themselves are fine, not gonna be super enjoyable every time but you will get there, if a little delayed. \n\nI think if you go 5/6 times in a year you would get your money's worth. But you could absolutely clean up going once or twice a month if you have the flexibility.\n\nI'd do a Ryanair version in a heartbeat...",

So the UK entity must have an account somewhere. As Citibank seems to be its main banking provider, and using the London branch for many currencies, it's most likely with them.)\n\nIf we [look on the Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20220929135853/https://wizzair.com/en-gb/information-and-services/booking-information/payments/how-to-make-a-bank-transfer) (the page doesn't load, but if you look at the HTML source and search for \"GBP\" you can see the relevant info), we can see that even in September 2022 the info was the same: Wizzair Hungary was the beneficiary. That Redditor's TPDO wasn't made until Jan 2023 - so the info would have been the same at the time they made it.\n\nThere is a chance ~~Piss~~Wizzair might have changed the account, but it's unlikely.

I had no choice but to pay because boarding was happening, and I didn‚Äôt want to cause a scene.\n\nThe most ridiculous part? When I got on the plane, there was no space in the overhead bins since I was one of the last to board‚Äîso I ended up putting my luggage under the seat anyway! Exactly where it was supposed to go in the first place.\n\nTo top it all off, I called Wizz Air‚Äôs customer service after the flight, and they were beyond rude.

I come here, hoping that there are people who have experience and knowledge regarding the Wizz Air Pilot Academy. I have multiple questions, so if you could take some time and answer, I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nFor context, I still have about a year and a half of high school ahead of me, so I'm not planning to apply now, and my family's financial situation is as follows: we aren't rich, we aren't poor. We can afford to live comfortably and very well. However we have nowhere near enough to cover all the costs that come with the journey of becoming an airline pilot through the usual university/flight school paths. The Wizz Air Pilot Academy is the only option that we know of, that we could somehow cover and pay for.\n\nFirstly, how high are the chances of getting accepted? I'm aware that the chances are different for everyone, depending on overall aptitude and level of preparation. But generally, what are the chances and what is the possibility of getting in? Is it very difficult, or is it insanely difficult?\n\nSecondly, this question is directly related to the first one, is it a good idea to have the Wizz Air Pilot Academy as my first option? I have seen someone on PPRuNe advising others not to have it as their plan A, because it apparently \"isn't the safest of options\" and it's absolutely not guaranteed that you'll get in, so you could be left with nothing if you go all in on this and end up not getting accepted.\n\nNext up, any advice for the interviews? How can I prepare and make a good impression? What do they look for? I believe I am generally very professional, I am aware that formal clothing is a must, but I have heard that they look for something specific in candidates, that \"something\" still being unknown to me.\n\nAnd lastly, what is your overall opinion on this program? What do you think are the benefits and drawbacks of the Wizz Air Pilot Academy?\n\nI imagine, if everything goes well, that I will apply sometime in late 2026/2027. If it's true that it's unwise to have it as my first option, the last thing I want is to wait for over a year (due to high school), prepare intensively, go there, do my best and, God forbid, fail and not get accepted. And ultimately to be forced to close the doors of this possible chapter in my life, if you understand what I mean.\n\nSo if you can help me, I will appreciate any response, thank you! :))",

      "Is there a gliding club near you? Almost every pilot I ever met who got into a cadet program had been flying gliders before. It shows interest in aviation, it means you have some of the basics down already, and it doesn‚Äôt cost much.\n\nThere are other cadet programs out there, afaik both Easyjet and Ryanair have or are setting up their own academies. \n\nAs for what the ‚Äúspecial something‚Äù is they‚Äôre looking for: beats me. All I know is that more than 95% of those who apply don‚Äôt get in. It‚Äôs definitely not easy. Also be prepared for a rather rigorous training process, with regular stage checks in between and the chance of being kicked out if your performance isn‚Äôt up to standards. \n\nLast but not least: take a good look at the conditions if you fail to get a job after your training. Generally, the cadet program isn‚Äôt ‚Äúfree‚Äù, you just pay it off after completion through some kind of bonding (you get reduced pay and are contractually obligated to stay with the airline for a certain amount of time). There are programs out there that will cancel your debt if you don‚Äôt get a job with the parent airline after a certain time; while others will want you to pay back parts or all of the costs no matter what. Definitely find out which group Wizzair belongs to.",
      "The airline schemes are a great option and it‚Äôs definitely worth applying for. But even if you are the absolutely ideal candidate the odds are still heavily against you. \n\nApply and do your best but have a plan B that you‚Äôre happy with.",
      "Hi, I joined WAPA exactly a year ago. \nAbout the whole application process, yes it is indeed difficult. There are several stages where you can fail. The most challenging one is the first one, the modular altitude test. When you hear that x% of people don‚Äôt get accepted, it is because they don‚Äôt take this exam seriously and they don‚Äôt practice. You can actually visit the exam website and pay for a demo test. \nThe second stage is the group exercise. Here, your team will be given a task, which you have to solve. It is not a tragedy if you fail, they want to see how you behave in a team. When i did it, my team solved the task, but they still sent 2 out of 6 applicants home, because they were not helping a lot. \nNext stage is the personal interview. This one is also a slippery slope, only talk about stuff you are absolutely sure of, because they will catch you bullshitting. Just be straight and simple. I‚Äôs say these are the biggest challenges in the application. \n\nI don‚Äôt recommend rushing the application, try to save up as much as you can first, and prepare for the initial exam. \n\nAbout the program itself, it is demanding for sure, but we are having a great time. The quality of the practical training is superb, instructors are amazing.\n\nLet me know if you have other questions.",
      "All they want is good return on their investment. Which means they want to see someone who has the highest chances of finishing the training and working as long as possible in Wizz. You must be very flexible with moving countries, they can put you wherever they want. Good physics,maths and English preparation is a must,even though you will not need advanced knowledge of the subjects in training. They just want to see you have spent time preparing. Research about the company,bases,fleet, when it was established. \n\nIt's a good first option. But nothing is guaranteed in aviation. \n\nI never went to WAPA, just ex employee",
      "Is it true that only people from certain countries can apply for the program? Could I for example apply from Finland? I am willing to move anywhere I am required."

    "text": "Hey everyone, just wanted to share our experience and see if anyone‚Äôs been through something similar or has advice.\n\nWe flew with Wizz Air from Copenhagen to Kutaisi in early March. Upon arrival, our snowboard bag never showed up. We reported it at the airport and got an irregularity report. The bag contained snowboard equipment and most of our snowboarding clothes - basically everything for the trip.\n\nWe had to buy new clothes (about ‚Ç¨800 worth) and rent gear for the week, which wasn‚Äôt cheap or fun. Eventually, we sent a formal compensation claim, listing all the documented expenses. Their response? A generic copy-paste message saying they won‚Äôt compensate for ‚Äúconsequential damages‚Äù like rentals, and they'll only cover 50% of essential item purchases (if anything). The most ridiculous - they even haven't offered to refund the luggage transport fee they charged for the bag that never arrived.\n\nTo make things worse, our travel insurance through Revolut (XCover) denied the claim because the baggage tag was under my partner‚Äôs name, even though the whole trip was booked under mine and paid with my Revolut card. We‚Äôre legally married, same booking, same flight, same insurance plan ‚Äî but they use that as an excuse to ghost the claim. Their support is basically non-existent.\n\nAt this point, we‚Äôve filed a complaint with the EU Consumer Centre in Denmark and are looking at small claims options too.\n\nHas anyone had success escalating something like this? Should we push Wizz Air harder, go to small claims court, or try a chargeback? Any advice appreciated.",

      "I'd read carefully read over the exact terms of your Revolut policy to make sure what they told you is what it says. See if you can find any provision at all that would cover your rentals and call them back with that.\n\nWith Wizz air you said they didn't offer to refund the luggage. Did you ask them to refund it? It might be a situation where they'll refund it but you have to ask directly.\n\nThe policy for not covering rentals is the same in any airline I can think of. They'll only cover hygiene products and change of clothes and that's it. The absolute basics. And then a set amount if they actually lost the baggage which doesn't seem to be the case for you. You won't be able to push Wizz Air there, but you should be able to get the baggage they didn't deliver refunded.",

    "text": "Hello guys, I had a flight from London Luton to Athens 19/02/2025, the flight delayed for 5,5 hours, and the reason was not exactly explained to us. I had booked through the Wizz Air app, flight number was W9 5409.\n\nTo sum up the story, we started boarding, (we were flying 15.45) and then the people that were boarding us told us there was an issue with the landing tires, one hour delay at least. We waited, they fixed it, and we started boarding again. \n\nSame thing again, they tell us that they made a mistake fixing it and now have to re-do the fix, another hour of delay. We go and sit and eventually after another hour they put us on the plane, and as we start to move in reverse to get on the runway, a bump / break was heard from underneath - behind the aircraft and we stopped. They called a mechanic to inspect it, they had us one hour aboard the aircraft waiting for a decision, and eventually they let us know that the fix for this new issue will take 2 hours at least. In the end at 21.15 we took off and arrived 3 hours later in the destination without any other problems.\n\nThe issue is that I filed for compensation as we are eligible for it (2.200km distance and more than 3 hours of delay), but Wizz Air came back with a reply of ‚Äúthe delay was due to extremely unforeseen circumstances such as either bird strike, lightning strike or damage due to foreign object on the ground, therefore we regret to inform you we will not be compensating you.\n\nI don‚Äôt know what to do as I feel they just gave that justification in order to save on the compensations. Sorry for the long post, what can I do (if I can do anything at all in this situation?) \n\nThanks in advance.\n",

      "That route is served by an A321. Width is the same as on all other Airbus A32x economy seating - 17.7 inches or 45 cm. However, contrary to most other ULCC airlines, the (Recaro SL3710 slimline) seats feature moveable armrests, so if you choose an aisle or window seat (or buy two) you can raise the armrest for more width. (here¬¥s a video by a Wizz cabin crew member showing how to raise the armrest: [Wizzair Arm Rest | TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@matei.biancaa/video/7276086673086221601))\n\nI do not know if the outer armrest (left side on 11 and 25 B, right side on  11 and 25E) are movable as I never sat in them.

If they are, those would be the  perfect seats to be in for oversize people as with the armrest raised you have practically unlimited \"spill room\":\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bxcvc4c3jvoe1.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=767cb1f457a2d5986e9a8c833769f3ebfc92d150\n\nPersonally, I¬¥d either book two seats or 11 B or E.\n\nStay away from the middle B/E seats in the first and exit rows, as those have fixed armrests on both sides that cut into seat width and will squish oversize people.\n\nEdit: Do not speculate on getting an empty adjacent seat. Wizzair aircraft are at 100% load more often than not, and  you did the right thing by coming here and asking before flying unprepared and having an utterly uncomfortable flight experience.",

I can drop many things from the 7KG ,and use another bag for 40L , if it will be more comfortable ?\n\nwhat I did ?\n\nI just pack cloths for 2 day + Cloths what I'm wear with 3.5K , I'm asking is that enough ?\n\nthe shoes inside make the bag looks big, I put running shoes in the bag.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5n7st4t1uexc1.jpg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c93e393933f9b0ef84cdd895854e9482eb926d9",

      "It will say the dimensions of allowed bags on the airlines website, you just have to measure your bag against them.",
      "My 40L has never had any issues but tbf it is tight fitting in the cabin and I always freak out thinking I'm gonna have to put it in hold despite the bag literally being sold as a cabin bag... things change sadly and I know in many cases it doesn't technically fit the airline carry on spec. But I've always been fine. \n\nI couldn't imagine the anxiety of trying to sneak past with 50L üòÜ",
      "Some airlines might be strict esp if you're going the budget route.",
      "50L seems big to me for something like you're describing. You would want to be slightly lower profile and pack a bit lighter. I have a 50L bag and I would say it's too much for what you're describing.\n\nDisclaimer: I've never done what you're about to do.",
      "The question, \"can I bring it on as carry-on\" comes up all the time on travel forums and it's always the very same answer and it's really simple:\n\n1.) Measure your item's dimensions.\n\n2.) Compare it to the carry-on dimensions for your airline.\n\n3.) It either fits, or it doesn't.\n\nIt's that easy.\n\nLastly, [here's a few thoughts and suggestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1ahhldw/carryon_sized_backpack_specifically_designed_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) about carry-on sized travel backpacks.\n\nHappy travels."

He has a Schengen visa that starts on 30th January, but his flight is scheduled to land in the Schengen area on 29th January at 11:30 PM.\n\nI know the visa rules are strict about not entering before the start date, but it‚Äôs only 30 minutes before midnight. And from a practical stand point, he'll most probably reach the immigration counter after 12 AM (valid visa) but my main concerns is\n\nWill the airline (wizz air) allow him to board the flight if they see that his visa starts on 30th January?\n\nIf anyone has experienced something similar or knows the rules well, I‚Äôd really appreciate your input. Thanks in advance!\n\nUpdate:\n\nThank you all for your answers...I really appreciate the time you took to respond.\n\nI completely understand that this was an issue on our side, and I would have fully accepted it if the airline had denied him boarding. It makes perfect sense not to allow someone to fly to a country without a valid visa.\n\nHowever, this was the only flight he could take since he wanted to attend my graduation ceremony on the 30th, and the 30th was the earliest start date he could get due to visa appointment availability.\n\nLuckily, my father used up all his luck for the year‚Äîthe flight was delayed by three hours, meaning he will now arrive in the Schengen area on the start date of his visa and he was allowed to board the plane.\n\nAgain, thank you all so much for your responses!\n",

    "text": "Building on a previous post ([http://redd.it/i2thge/](http://redd.it/i2thge/)) asking the community to pick underrated stocks, there was interest in seeing the quarterly performance of everyone's picks\n\nThe first quarter can be seen here: [http://redd.it/jti14m/](http://redd.it/jti14m/)\n\nFor this quarter, the key takeaways are as follows:\n\n* Overall average return of 72.2% (driven by the GME pick)\n* If you invested equally in each stock, returns would have been 41.9%, or if you bought one of each stock, returns would have been 37.5%\n* 86% of the 254 picks have shown a positive return, with 80% greater than 10% return and 20% greater than 100% return\n* Highest returning pick: Gamestock (GME) at 1342% flagged by  /u/EmployerOfTheMonth, to which they stated *\"If it goes up, people will think I'm some sort genius for going against the crowd, if it goes down, people will just mindly brush me off as a moron for actually thinking this was underrated\"*\n* If you invested in the top 5 most upvoted stocks (NET, CRSP, STNE, NVDA, NOK), you would have seen an average return of 62%\n* If you invested in the top 5 most controversial stocks (TSLA, WD, AMD, LMND, UBER), you would have seen a return of 93%\n* If you had invested equally in the stocks with greater than 10% return in the first 30 days, your total return would be 53.1%\n\nIn graphical format, you can also see the results here: [https://i.imgur.com/CzEYTxv.png](https://i.imgur.com/CzEYTxv.png)\n\n# For those who keep asking for another round of tracking underrated stocks, I'll add a comment below to collect new picks to monitor.  Happy to update you on a similar cadence.\n\nAs a reminder, please do not interpret results seen here as an endorsement of the investing prowess of the community. Invest at your own risk.\n\nFor reference, below is a table of the current stocks sorted by performance\n\n|**Symbol**|**Company**|**Delta**|**Provided by**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**GME**|GameStop Corp.|1342%|/u/EmployerOfTheMonth|\n|**FCEL**|FuelCell Energy Inc|885%|/u/i-kno-nothing, /u/dewaser|\n|**EH**|EHang Holdings Ltd -

    "text": "Good morning from the UK\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Virus update**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe WHO dashboard ([Link](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/685d0ace521648f8a5beeeee1b9125cd)) reports 95,265 cases (that's an increase of 2.3% from yesterday).  2 more countries have reported cases, bringing the total amount of countries to 79.  Countries with more than 100 cases:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- China: 80565 (up 0.2% - I am suspicious of this, it seems like a very low increase)\n\n\\- South Korea: 5766 (up another 8.2%)\n\n\\- Italy: 3089 (up another 23.5%)\n\n\\- Iran: 2922 (up another 94.7%, yesterday's jump was 55.6%, they have a real problem)\n\n\\- Japan: 320 (up 11.5%)\n\n\\- France: 285 (up 34.4%)\n\n\\- Germany: 262 (up 33.7)\n\n\\- Spain: 200 (up 32.5%)\n\n\\- USA: 219 (which is more than double yesterday's figure, they're up 103.8%)\n\n\\- Singapore: 110 (no change)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe UK has tripled in the past 48 hours and now has 90 and most likely will also go into triple digits tomorrow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Epoch Times is reporting (in Chinese: [Link](https://www.epochtimes.com/gb/20/3/4/n11913654.htm)) that \"CDC\" and \"Coronavirus\" are being censored on WeChat (which go a long way to explaining why I'm not getting any sources from it); it turns out that the filter has been in place since as early as December last year with an expansion of blocked keywords in February 2020.  Other related filtered content includes criticism of the government, so could outbreak rumours and speculation and posts about the whistleblower Dr Li Wenliang.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPublic Service announcement for Americans - Medicare now covers coronavirus testing.  For more info see [Link](https://www.medicare.gov/blog/medicare-now-covers-coronavirus-testing)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Economics**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bank of Canada cuts key interest rate to 1.25% due to Coronavirus concerns -** Supply Pro Canada reports ([Link](https://www.supplypro.ca/bank-of-canada-cuts-key-rate-to-1-25-per-cent-amid-coronavirus-concerns/)) that the bank of Canada has cut its interest rate by 0.5% due to the economic shock from the coronavirus outbreak.  The bank adds that it's becoming clear the country will not grow as much as its previous forecasts indicated with rail line blockades, teacher strikes in Ontario and a harsh winter also impacting on growth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Supply chain specific**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**China cargo flows rapidly return to pre-coronavirus levels -** Freightwaves reports [Link](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/china-cargo-flows-rapidly-return-to-pre-coronavirus-levels)) that  cargo volumes and ship calls have rapidly rebounded at Chinese ports, indicating that movements are rapidly returning back to normal.  It adds (personal note: I second this point) that it remains to be seen in the coming weeks and months whether volumes will drop again if there are manufacturing disruptions or reduced demand in consumer markets or potentially they may increase if China pursues a stimulus program. Dry bulk has mostly recovered, energy has fully recovered and container imports into China may be higher than they were before the Chinese New Year.  CargoMetrics continues to analyse import and export flows into other countries including South Korea, Italy and Iran and so far is not seeing anything unusual.  Whilst this is good news, the CEO of Sea-Intelligence cautioned that the ripple effects of the virus are far from over pointing to capacity crunch problems and equipment availability (i.e. empty containers) for backhaul cargoes from the US and Europe heading back to Asia.  For some backhaul shippers, it may be difficult to move their products at all in the coming months regardless of the price they're willing to pay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Passenger airlines further reducing flight schedules amid coronavirus -** Freightwaves is reporting ([Link](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/delta-reduces-japan-flight-schedule-amid-coronavirus-downturn/)) that Delta has been forced to reduce service to Japan due to suppressed travel demand; it's already reduced services to China, Hong Kong, South Korea and two cities in Italy.  Other airlines cutting back flights include All Nippon airways domestic services as well as United globally.  In a message to United employees, their CEO announced voluntary, unpaid leave of absence or reduced work schedules, a hiring freeze, postponed new hire training class and postponed salary increases until July 1st.  T%he story is picked up elsewhere in European media with Forbes reporting ([Link](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidnikel/2020/03/03/sas-to-cut-flights-in-scandinavia--europe-as-coronavirus-hits-demand/#6d45c4b9110f)) a cut in SAS's schedule in Scandinavia and mainland Europe, while the FT (FT: [Link](https://www.ft.com/content/181d111e-5e33-11ea-8033-fa40a0d65a98)) reports Virgin Atlantic has reduced its CEO's pay by 20% for the next four months and also reports that Ryanair, Lufthansa and Easyjet have all cut Italy services with Wizz Air likely to follow suit soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**IATA: Cargo declined in January but Covid-19 impact yet to be felt -** Aircargonews.net reports ([Link](https://www.aircargonews.net/data/iata-cargo-declined-in-january-but-covid-19-impact-yet-to-be-felt/)) that IATA says that the full extent of Coronavirus is yet to be felt while global demand fell 3.3% in January vs the same month last year.  It places the cause of the drop due to the timing of the Chinese New Year and the US-China trade war tensions and adds that the Coronavirus outbreak did not have a major impact on January's cargo performance but expects the presence of the virus in the region will put pressure on performance for several months. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Airfreight rate data points to China demand surge ahead -** Intra-Asia air freight rates are likely to surge in the coming weeks due to a spike in demand says aircargonews.net ([Link](https://www.aircargonews.net/data/airfreight-rate-data-points-to-china-demand-surge-ahead/)).  Already Singapore to China rates are higher than last year, with China to South Korea rates more than 20% this time last year.  The article adds that some freighter schedules have recommenced including Lufthansa, Qatar, Emirates and Cargolux whilst Cathay Pacific has parked half of its fleet and suspended 3/4 of its scheduled flights.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Happy 50th birthday to Cargolux!**  [Link](https://www.aircargonews.net/airlines/cargolux-celebrates-50th-anniversary/) One of the leading European freight only operators has turned 50.  The carrier was the first to fly both the 747-400F and 747-8F.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**South Korea faces 'unprecedented' supply chain chaos from spread of Coronavirus -** According to an article in splash247 ([Link](https://splash247.com/south-korea-faces-unprecedented-supply-chain-chaos-from-spread-of-coronavirus/)), South Korea is facing significant supply chain disruption including manufacturing, shipping, ports and shipyards.  Major South Korean companies including Samsung, LG and Hyundai have all been hit forcing closures of some of their factories whilst sourcing parts from China has also been problematic.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**U.S. Ports Likely to See Slump in Cargo Volume From Coronavirus -** The WSJ reports ([Link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-ports-likely-to-see-slump-in-cargo-volume-from-coronavirus-11583274643)) that US ports are expected to handle 20% less cargo this quarter due to fewer inbound shipments from China.  To date, containership operators have canceled nearly 60 trans Pacific sailings to LA and Long Beach in particular and roughly 110 trans Pacific sailings to N America as a whole between early February to Early April, says Sea-Intelligence (a maritime analytics company).  Terminals at Long Beach (a major US seaport) are reporting they're operating at 30-40% of normal gate capacity according to a trucking industry group although the port expects things to rebound back eventually.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Port of LA taking 'substantial hit' from Coronavirus -** Freightwaves says ([Link](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/port-of-la-taking-substantial-hit-from-coronavirus/)) that the port of Los Angeles is already taking a significant hit from reduced volumes; the Executive Director there expects Q1 volumes to plunge 15% vs the same period in 2019 with 40 sailings heading to LA having been cancelled.  He warns of a whipsaw effect with empties and exports needing to be moved out of the port to get ready for a ramp back up once the virus is curbed or eradicated.  The Georgia ports Authority expects that they could see volumes drop by 40% in March and April vs the same time last year but in the same article, the major container carrier CMA CGM confirmed they too are seeing manufacturing activities in China picking up with more truck drivers returning to their posts.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Coronavirus restricting flow of goods into Canada: CN CEO - S**upplypro Canada reports ([Link](https://www.supplypro.ca/coronavirus-restricting-flow-of-goods-into-canada-cn-ceo/)) that the plunge in imports from China is now beginning to affect Canadian National Railway company.  Container shipments make up more than 25% of their revenues with China accounting for the biggest part of shipments from West coast ports.  The company is also having to deal with blockades relating to an ongoing dispute with indigenous tribes over a proposed gas pipeline which will result in significant loss of revenue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**AliExpress warns of delays for overseas shipments -** Gizbot reports [Link](https://www.gizbot.com/amphtml/news/aliexpress-warns-customers-about-late-shipment-due-to-coronavirus-066079.html)) that AliExpress (owned by Alibaba) is warning of delays to overseas shipments due to the virus outbreak with some customers complaining that orders taking a long time to arrive are getting renewed automatically.  The company has more than 79m annual active users.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**UK hand sanitiser sales up 255% in February as grocers see healthier performance -** logisticsmanager.com reports ([Link](https://www.logisticsmanager.com/hand-sanitiser-sales-up-255-in-february-as-grocers-see-healthier-performance/)) that year on year supermarket sales were up 0.7% with Sainsbury's emerging as the winner amongst the big 6.  An analyst from Kantar added that Sales of hand sanitiser increased by 255% in February. Meanwhile, other kinds of liquid soaps saw sales increase by 7%, and 10% more was spent on household cleaners.  (Personal note: I spent 20 minutes yesterday trying to buy more alcohol hand gel sanitiser for our office and failed, with one supplier saying the next resupply won't be until July).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**50% of Uk retailers experiencing supply chains disruption -** Retail Week reports [Link](https://www.retail-week.com/supply-chain/coronavirus-half-of-uk-retailers-grappling-supply-chain-disruption/7034288.article) that 52% of British retailers have experienced delays in their supply chains due to the virus with a quarter saying it was a significant issue.  Only 7% of retailers surveyed said their supply chains were flexible enough to switch away from China however.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Baby Yoda toy shortage threat -** CNN advises ([Link](https://us.cnn.com/2020/03/04/business/coronavirus-baby-yoda/index.html)) that Hasbro (the maker of the toy) has said its supply chain is being disrupted.  Whilst production of baby Yoda toys specifically haven't been affected yet, that may change if normality hasn't returned by June and July with Hasbro warning that multiple toys will experience shortages.  Currently the company's biggest issue is sourcing raw materials which are almost exclusively made in China.  The COO added that in the coming years they will move about 50% of their supply chain out of China. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**VW scrambling to source enough parts to keep its Chattanooga assembly line running -** [Commercialappeal.com](https://Commercialappeal.com) says ([Link](https://amp.commercialappeal.com/amp/4951561002)) that VW's supply chain is \"very much in triage\", quoting VW's Group of America CEO in a letter to their 650 dealerships.  The article adds that some industrial experts (personal note: presumably they also read the Harvard Business Review article then) suggest supplies may empty out by mid March.  The CEO committed to a supply of 80,000 new vehicles over the next 4 months.  The VW Logistics team are said to be working around the clock to secure the necessary parts.  \"More than 200 of our (logistics) colleagues have been in near-constant touch with suppliers around the world. We‚Äôve put parts on flights from China and pulled them off trains headed to Detroit to be flown directly to our plants.‚Äù.  Chattanooga employs around 4,900 workers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**US military supply chain beginning to be impacted -** Inside Defense reports ([Link](https://insidedefense.com/insider/pentagon-planning-possible-supply-chain-disruptions-coronavirus)) that Lockheed Martin's factory has directed all employees at its F35 manufacturing plant in Cameri, Italy to remain home due to the virus outbreak.  For now it appears the F35 deliveries will be unaffected.  A Pentagon spokesman added that the US Defense Department remains fully engaged with all suppliers for all programs and is ready to respond when needed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Good news section** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Attention all students who have read this far down - T**he Maersk graduate scheme has just opened.  Click for more info and to apply here: [https://www.gowithmaersk.com/](https://www.gowithmaersk.com/).  (Personal note: I did the Maersk graduate scheme once I finished my Bachelors degree, it was really good).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ningbo-Zhoushan port (the worlds largest container port) announces 5.6m TEU expansion -** Splash247 reports the port has mapped out a large extension to its container terminals.  Last year it handled 1.1bn tonnes of cargo (more than many countries in total).  Last year it handled 27.53m TEU.  The article doesn't say when the new terminals will come online.

Another of his funds had already placed a 0.73pc bet against the FTSE 100 group that also owns Iberia and Aer Lingus.\n\nA day later IAG shares¬†jumped more than 11pc. The stock is trading at 160p, valuing the company at almost ¬£8bn.\n\nCitadel was not the only hedge fund to be hit by renewed optimism about fortunes of the airlines sector. London-based Sandbar Asset Management amassed bets of ¬£110m against the London-listed IAG, easyJet and Wizz Air on Dec 30.\n\nA large Republican donor, Mr Griffin said he would bankroll the party‚Äôs candidate for the governorship of his home state of Illinois this year - a position held by another billionaire, JB Pritzker.\n\nLast November he paid $43m for a copy of the US constitution at a Sotheby‚Äôs auction following a bidding war against cryptocurrency traders.\n\nAirline stocks have risen after carriers said bookings were significantly higher than 12 months ago.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ryanair said it had flown 9.5m passengers in December, up from 1.9m for the same month in 2020.¬†¬†\n\nWizz Air said on Tuesday it was flying at 80pc of pre-pandemic levels despite the impact of the new variant.\n\nThe easyJet chief executive,¬†Johan Lundgren, has said he expects the budget airline to be back to normal this summer. Shares rose 2.7pc to 624p, roughly the same price as the start of 2021.\n\nAnd in a further boon to the sector, the Government is expected to¬†stop asking passengers for pre-departure Covid tests¬†and will drop a requirement for a confirmatory PCR test if they test positive on their return.\n\nThe UK‚Äôs testing regime has been blamed by airline bosses for putting Britons off from flying.\n\nCitadel has been contacted for comment.¬†",

    "text": "I've been travelling with one bag, a 44 litre Osprey, for ten years. It used to be super easy. Every airline had a simple policy... one personal, one carry on. \n\nNow whenever I buy a ticket, I have to meticulously scroll through every airlines policy to find out how they're going to gauge me at the gate. \n\nFor example I'm going to Romania from Mexico. \n\nVolaris... you get one \"hand luggage\" which must fit under the seat. So, you have to buy the upgrade, unless your ticket says \"Two bags\" then they must weigh under 8 kilos, combined. That last mistake cost me $25 usd. \n\nNext flight, TUI airways... you get one bag carry on, no personal item. It must all fit in the one bag that meets size requirements. So, get ready to stuff everything into one bag at the gate, including all your electronics, so you can take it all out again on the plane, because only newbs leave their valuables out of sight. \n\nNext is Wizz air, you can bring one bag up to 10 kg, which is plenty.. but it must fit under the seat in front of you. Lol, so you must upgrade for $25 usd to add a \"Trolley bag\". \n\nThis all gets really confusing when you're trying to find budget flights on Google flights, skyscanner, etc. Because you want to just buy all the tickets at once, but Google may not be smart enough to know that your carry on of 10kg must fit under the seat in front of you, or your carry on doesn't allow for a personal item (where I keep my passports, laptops, go pro, food, etc). \n\nPersonally, I think it's all bullshit, and just mean to confuse and gauge customers at the gate. And at the gate it is always 25% to 50% more than upgrading online. There should be some sort of regulation for the airlines to make this uniform. \n\nFor now, to save myself $100 in baggage fees (they cost more if you don't upgrade online... also watch that you print your papers before arriving or they charge you for that too) I research the flights on Google Flights, then buy and upgrade all the luggage individually if my Osprey doesn't meet the specifications. \n\nI mean, who's going to travel from Mexico to Europe with one personal bag that fits under the seat? Why even have that option? It's absurd. \n\nJust five years ago, all of this was really simple.",

Until they added ¬£100 for a checked bag and ¬£10+ per meal on the flight making the total only ¬£30 cheaper than flying Qatar who are decent enough to include those in the listed price... You bet I switched to Qatar instead!",
      "Basically because you're flying low-cost. It has that name because its cheap to get on the flight, but you need to pay for extra shit.\n\nAlso, welcome to Rom√¢nia. Prepare yourself to have a huge delay with Wizzair.",
      "You listed all budget airlines. Even national carriers are unbundling services to be ‚Äúmore competitive‚Äù with these budget airlines. Further, prices for travel airline travel is up at the moment. \n\nWhile I do miss the carry on and personal item policy as the standard for all airlines, I also appreciate the drop in price on carriers with routes I previously didn‚Äôt travel."

This is why I notice things that are very out of the ordinary very quickly, which is exactly what happened on Friday the 27th October 2023. \n\n  \nA normal flight from the mainland of Spain to UAE was my original destination but because model agencies have to cover costs they tend to prefer booking cheaper alternatives with multiple stops. Hence, my flight consisted of flying from Budapest back to UAE on a WizzAir flight.\n\n  \nMy flight boarded when the first weird thing that stood out to me happened. A well dressed man infant of me was walking up to the stairs to get into the plane, holding an abnormally large premature baby task trainer. For some strange reason it stood out to me so much I even thought to take a picture of this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/plpzlsd5udnd1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=65fc251fbd2ec2a6e4b5f888ef1dbc5af5a08453\n\nAs we boarded the plane he was placed on the same aisle seat opposite me but 1 row ahead of me. He lifted his heavy training machine into the overhead compartment, almost taking up the entire compartment meaning only 1 other bag was able to fit from the passenger. How was this allowed onto the plane in the first place? especially low cost airlines make the biggest fuss with onboard luggage and if it was too big he would have had to put it in foil wrap and then into storage down in the plane. No money can buy an extra large suitcase to bring onto a plane when they ask you to pay for extra luggage, if the suitcase is too big, its too big.\n\nI had a very clear view of his laptop as this was the first thing that he immediately pulled out, put on his table and started watching an online seminar. The sun had set now as we lifted into the air as everyone started to sleep, everyone but one. The man who was watching his doctor seminar on a bright MacBook Pro screen. His laptop was so bright it must have been in full brightness, he lit up the entire section making it obvious by now he was a doctor.\n\n  \nNow by this time we are at cruising altitude above the Middle East. Everyone is sleeping except me and the \"doctor\". (I can never sleep on planes, I'm 6,4 and a light sleeper). I noticed someone walk past me up the aisle and go to cabin crew, when they all of a sudden closed the curtains. They were speaking to the person quietl, looking a bit worried but still all calm. \n\n  \nTen minutes later, an announcement was made on board if any doctors can come forward and please help- ZOOM the \"doctor\" next to me slammed his laptop and ran up the aisle and closed the curtains behind. People obviously woke up because of the commotion as no one knew what was going on. \n\n  \nAnother 10 minutes pass and the next announcement was made that we will be doing an emergency landing so everyone put your seats up and tray tables stowed back get ready for a landing. The stewardess walked past and the couple next to me asked where we were landing... good question I thought to myself. The replied with Iraq, Baghdad. \n\n  \nWhen this news came out to more and more people everyone started getting very nervous and angry towards the crew members. People were questioning if it was safe, or if we cannot just fly 30 minutes backwards to turkey ?. The crew told us that the doctor on board said it has to be now and here. Since the doctor was now responsible for the person \"sick\" he apparently said he would rather do an emergency landing now.\n\n  \nHe stayed in front of the plane with the person (who by the way no one can still see or hear) as I look at his empty seat with his belongings still laid out. We landed and the doctor came back to his seat as 1 person walked out the plane quietly (I could see feet walking that did not match the uniform shoes of the cabin crew so I figured it was him/her). \n\n  \nI also noticed at this point if the sick person was leaving the aircraft where is the luggage from them? I noticed no cabin crew had brought it to them other than a small bag. no suitcase no onboard bag, just a small pouch. Who flies from Budapest to Dubai with a small pouch bag ?\n\n  \nThe doctor sat back down to his seat when a heated argument broke out with the person sitting on his row on the window seat exclaimed that he was a doctor as well and would like to know what could have possibly been so serious for us having to land but there was no commotion upfront ?\n\n  \nThe doctor replied angrily \"leave me alone, you have no idea what you're talking about\", as he turned to the cabin crew and said \"I want him off this flight\", Long story short after lots of back and forth the \"doctor\" moved to the back row of the plane and stayed for the rest of the flight. \n\n  \nWe eventually landed when I open my phone to my mom and dad messaging me why I have not replied in three hours even though my plane landed 3 hours ago. I called them and immediately told them what happened. They told me to take the taxi home and they will look at the.flight details out of interest. \n\n  \nThey could not find anything ?? No data was shown of an emergency landing, no unusual patterns. Even the status mentioned that the plane arrived early.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/loqxaokkydnd1.png?width=650&format=png&auto=webp&s=522e6b2e0872558b840ab5b7ea52a1c1302d8d3f\n\n  \nMy father managed to contact his friend who works at Frankfurt air traffic control tower and they looked into this within the same hour. Normally when a plane makes an emergency landing, they will report it back from their destination of departure, Budapest, and because Budapest is in Europe and Frankfurt is a main airport for logistics they normally can be made aware of this as well. In the meantimeI had sent my parents screenshots of the SMS I received when we landed in Iraq just to really prove what happened.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gih0hqiwydnd1.png?width=550&format=png&auto=webp&s=060e056ea17daf475e95b9a03bed21bb1d710d76\n\nAfter a couple more hours we received confirmation that Frankfurt tower and Budapest tower were indeed NOT informed and that they cannot find anything on the radars other than the altitude recordings. The altitude recordings indeed show that above Iraq, Wizz air was too low to be detected and therefore is shown in the image below in green.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/72p5isv8zdnd1.png?width=422&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a6add0b81ca6998645f4da9f6c9780d7d4fe397\n\nI have a couple of questions:\n\n\n\n- Why was the doctor making it so obvious that he was a doctor (bright seminar screen and practice equipment)?\n\n- Why was he so quick to run towards the plane to make sure he was the first to call out as a first aid responder\n\n- How did he manage to get the training kit, that's way too big, onto the plane in the first place?\n\n- Is it even possible for someone to have such a bad emergency that no one can hear anything or see anything ? \n\n- who Travels to Dubai with only a small pouch ?\n\n- Why travel immediatelyto Iraq and not other safer options such as Kuwait, Saudi, Turkey.\n\n- Why did the doctor get so defensive when people questioned his decision to land in Iraq?\n\n- Why is there absolutely no flight data of the emergency landing \n\n- Was this a international spy making their way into a country somehow ?",

He has a Schengen visa that starts on 30th January, but his flight is scheduled to land in the Schengen area on 29th January at 11:30 PM.\n\nI know the visa rules are strict about not entering before the start date, but it‚Äôs only 30 minutes before midnight. And from a practical stand point, he'll most probably reach the immigration counter by 12 AM (valid visa) but my main concerns is\n\nWill the airline (wizz air) allow him to board the flight if they see that his visa starts on 30th January?\n\nIf anyone has experienced something similar or knows the rules well, I‚Äôd really appreciate your input. Thanks in advance!\n\n\nUpdate:\n\nThank you all for your answers...I really appreciate the time you took to respond.\n\nI completely understand that this was an issue on our side, and I would have fully accepted it if the airline had denied him boarding. It makes perfect sense not to allow someone to fly to a country without a valid visa.\n\nHowever, this was the only flight he could take since he wanted to attend my graduation ceremony on the 30th, and the 30th was the earliest start date he could get due to visa appointment availability.\n\nLuckily, my father used up all his luck for the year‚Äîthe flight was delayed by three hours, meaning he will now arrive in the Schengen area on the start date of his visa and he was allowed to board the plane.\n\nAgain, thank you all so much for your responses!\n",

I know someone with a very similar situation traveling from Abu Dhabi and their flight was going to arrive 11:50 and still they didn‚Äôt allow it. Because, technically you don‚Äôt have a valid visa and airlines may need to pay huge fines if the destination country blamed the airline for boarding the passenger",
      "The airline may well refuse him boarding. If the airline DOES allow him to board, he should wait until after midnight to approach the immigration counter, just to be on the safe side.\n\nConsidering how long it typically takes to get to the gate, get people off the plane and get TO immigration, he probably won't have to wait long.",

      "The problem here, as you noted, is the airline permitting him to board.  That's going to depend on how much of a jerk the airline staff want to be.  Technically, your father does not have a valid visa.\n\nGood luck, but you/your father shouldn't have booked this flight.",

    "text": "So I (21M) just did an intense solo speed run through 25 countries in Europe in 3 weeks plus two weeks of laid back Italy and France travel using Eurail pass. Tiny backpack with everything in it, the cheapest hostels, nothing fancy. Had a blast and had absolutely zero problems. \n\nHonestly,  Eurail is kind of overpriced and you have to pay extra for seat reservations or have to straight up buy some tickets (especially in France and Italy), and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it in most cases because flights in Europe on discount airlines are so cheap.  BUT if you qualify for the youth pass like I did (flights cost the same no matter your age) AND you are planning on going to a bunch of places it could potentially be worth it. For example, I took 89 trains total which probably would‚Äôve cost at least $2000-3000+ without eurail, which was ~$560 for me for one month youth. But also had great experiences on 4 dirt cheap flights I took on easyjet, Ryanair, wizz air, they are perfectly fine and will get you where you need to go. \n\nIn total, I went to Italy, Switzerland, France, Spain, Monaco, San Marino, The Vatican, Austria, Germany, Czechia, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Slovenia, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, and Malta. Had to get quite a few tests (like 6 total maybe?), had to fill out digital locator forms, never got COVID, never really had any problems. \n\n Random recommendations for travel in age of COVID: \n\n‚ÄîGet vaccinated, including booster. You won‚Äôt get very far without vaccine, you can‚Äôt even take train or metro or go into grocery stores in some European countries here. \n\n\n‚Äîget the digital EU covid certificate, not just CDC card if you can. You need proof of vaccination to do anything or even to take trains. I got my EU digital certificate through the Swiss website. Apparently you can convert your American vaccine card to digital passport in France for a fee as well. Edit: I think CDC card is also okay? But it‚Äôs definitely nice to have same format where it can be scanned as everyone else. \n\n‚ÄîDigital locator forms - fill these out online before you go to new countries if you want them. Required for a bunch of countries. \n\n\n‚ÄîFFP2 mask - try to get them before you go to Austria, Germany, Italy you need it for train \n\n\n‚ÄîSeat reservations for trains - you need it on a bunch of trains in Italy, France, Germany,  Denmark. In general if you‚Äôre taking an international train you probably need to book seat reservation.  \n\n\n‚ÄîCovid tests - you need them to enter a couple of countries while traveling within the EU free movement area. For example, Finland, Italy, Malta, Czechia all have them right now. Pretty easy to get in general but antigen tests are usually around 25-40 euros and PCR can easily be 100 euros + so keep that in mind when budgeting. For example, I spent more on the test to go to helsinki from talinn then I did on the actual ferry tickets. \n\n\n‚ÄîLook up info for entering new countries ahead of time. The Schengenvisainfo website has some good country specific info under their news section, reopen EU is helpful, googling country name + covid and looking at news is helpful.\nIn general, once you‚Äôre in the schengen you should be good to travel pretty much anywhere if you‚Äôre vaxxed. Some countries have new restrictions and testing before entry, look at the website 1-2 days in advance so you can get your tests and digital locator forms and paperwork done. I doubt the borders will ever be fully shut down for vaccinated individuals again (fingers crossed lol).\n\nGeneral budget travel tips: \n\n\n‚ÄîTo save extra money on Ryanair or budget airlines which only give you a tiny tiny bag for free, wear the biggest coat you have and fill the pockets with your items, clothes, and toiletries \n\n\n‚ÄîFor big cities/ pickpocket destinations, keep your passport, cash, and cards in your pants in travel wallet or around your neck and use Apple Pay (accepted pretty much anywhere) or have a little cash in seperate wallet. \n\n\nIf you‚Äôre hesistant about traveling during COVID, don‚Äôt be, I say just go for it (provided you can handle the consequences of a test coming up positive and possible 14 day quarantine). I‚Äôm double vaxxed (getting the booster when I get back) and never tested positive or contracted the virus as far as I know. Of course you need to be flexible and I wouldn‚Äôt drop too much money on non refundable stuff, but chances are, you‚Äôll be just fine. Even though everything is constantly changing, I had absolutely zero problems on my trip and had a wonderful time. Happy to answer any questions about COVID travel in the EU or answer any country specific questions to the best of my ability.\n\nTLDR: you can 100% travel all around Europe right now, I see lots of anxiety on this subreddit about COVID, just have some extra money budgeted for covid tests and definitely have plans and money budgeted so you‚Äôre not wrecked if you get a positive test.\n\n[Map of where I went](https://imgur.com/gallery/vrH7Jik)\n\n[a few photos ](https://imgur.com/gallery/Zv5LP6L)",

    "text": "henever I check into a hotel, I feel a little out of place because I feel like I'm the only one who has a regular suitcase. It seems like the vast majority of solo travelers prefer to use thor giant \"hippie backpacks\" with shoes and stuff hanging off the side. That looks incredibly uncomfortable. My back starts hurting after wearing a normal sized backpsck for awhile, so I really try to avoid carrying backpacks as much possible and making them as light as possible. I love my suitcases. In my opinion, nothing beats having wheels. They are also easier to pack and get things out of. No need to take out everything if there is something I want at the bottom. Another advantage, in the case of my rollerboard, I know for a fact that it will fit in the overhead bin or rack (I like that suitcases are fairly standardised). This might be unrelated , but I have had gate attendants be jerks about my normal sized backpack (this was wizz air. Never had problems with any other airline.) \n\nSo, what are the advantages of giant backpacks that that I'm missing? What do you like about them? What do you not like about suitcases? Is there anyone else here who also prefers suitcases? And, does your back hurt?\n\nThanks",

      "Many people find it easier and more comfortable to have a backpack than lug around a suit case. Especially when dealing with lots of stairs, cobblestones, hiking etc.",
      "A lot of solo travellers do hostels where its inconvenient. Plus a big case sucks to carry around in countries with bad streets",
      "I wind easily through crowds of travelers needing 2x less walking space with a backpack. Cobblestones are very annoying with any roller I‚Äôve used. Hopping up and down curbs without a thought. Suitcases hurt my back more when lugging it up and down stairs leaning to one side. My large-ish backpack fits in all carry on requirements, even budget airlines because it‚Äôs low depth. When flights start gate checking bags for full flights they stop all rolling ones but usually ignore my backpack. Also, you can‚Äôt make a hard case smaller to fit leftover overhead space but mine squashes above or between suitcases. Shoes tied in the side is for when they are muddy or wet from hiking or rain (not because they don‚Äôt fit) so you don‚Äôt dirty the rest of your luggage. The amount of time I spend thinking about the mobility of my bag is almost none and therefore I get to look around at beautiful views and not down at the ground navigating my suitcase. I like that when I buy something as I‚Äôm moving between lodgings I pop it in the top and don‚Äôt have to open a suitcase in full view and show everyone my dirty clothes. It has a stored rain cover built in. The straps cinch it across the back so it changes sizes with volume‚Äîstart a trip small and it can grow. Dragging a suitcase, I always have to change arms to even the strain on each arm, backpack always even.",
      "\"hippie\" backpacks help you be mobile. Roller cases are hard to bring around cities with cobble stone streets, hills, stairs. If you're stuck on transport where you are forced to keep your luggage on your lap backpacks are easier. They often have much more support than a normal backpack so will be more comfortable (FYI if you have a decent backpack and it hurts you likely have it set up wrong) . And as you said you can easily attach things to the outside, I've never seen a roller case with a water bottle holder. \n\n\nA 40l backpack fits in overhead bins as much as a small roller and will carry more stuff since you're not losing a few inches for the wheels. Plenty have clamshell opening like a suitcase too so no need to dig to the bottom of a bag.\n\n\nTo generalize backpacks are used by more mobile and adventurous travellers who move around a lot. Rollers are more for people who'll check into one hotel or resort and stay there for their trip, or people who can't physically carry a large backpack.",
      "I think you‚Äôll probably find a lot of overlap between solo travellers and ‚Äòone bag‚Äô travellers. I prefer a backpack or a duffel/backpack hybrid, carry-on size because I can move hands-free, I don‚Äôt have to worry about wheels on cobblestones or stairs. I keep things to under 7 kilos."

We'll call this the 'curve-ball' as it's a fair bit more than my ¬£50 target for these newsletters, but the deal was too good not to include. I've even been able to find direct flights which should save you about 11 hours from the slightly cheaper two-part flights I found for ¬£10 cheaper. Winning!!!

I might try do a more expensive list of flights this week, but as crazy deals (e.g: found Cuba 350 rtn!). I'll see what else I can find :-)\n\n---\n\n## üá¨üá∑ Kefalonia, Greece (¬£77 rtn)\nTo start with, I've got Cephalonia (formerly Kefalonia), found in Greece. It's an exotic island (I mean just [look....](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/imageserver/image/methode%2Ftimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2F457914f8-754d-11e8-a4b0-c06c25e9bae2.jpg?crop=4849%2C2727%2C522%2C601)) and is part of the Ionian Islands.

You'll have nice cold weathers, with markets to visit, coffee shops, theatres to explore and I'm sure a few stiff drinks to try out üç∏\n\nAverage temperature this time of year: ~1&#176;c to -3&#176;c\n\n|  From  |  To  | Out  | Return | Airline | Price  |\n|--------|------|------|--------|---------|--------|\n| LTN | VKO | Fri, 22 Nov @ 06:50  | Mon, 25 Nov @ 14:15| Wizz Air | ¬£62\n\n\n\n## üáÆüáπ Milan, Italy from Manchester (¬£23 rtn)\nAfter last week, there have been a few requests to start including more airports from around the country, so this week I did a little looking from Manchester. I've been able to find a good looking Manchester to Milan return flight for ¬£23 returns per person. With no shortage of night life and stunning architecture, I think this might be a steal of a weekend break!\n\nAverage temperature this time of year: ~11&#176;c\n\n|  From  |  To  | Out  | Return | Airline | Price  |\n|--------|------|------|--------|---------|--------|\n| MAN | MXP | Thu, 7 Nov @ 07:25 | Sun, 10 Nov @ 10:30 | Ryanair | ¬£23\n\n\n\n## üá∫üá∏ New York, USA (1wk, ¬£233 rtn)\nClearly breaking the ~¬£50 a trip rule, this flight to New York seemed like a good deal to share. You'll be going for a week in January - perfect for the January sales and to see the city in a christmas-y atmosphere.\n\nAverage temperature this time of year: ~4&#176;c to -3&#176;c\n\n|  From  |  To  | Out  | Return | Airline | Price  |\n|--------|------|------|--------|---------|--------|\n| LGW | JFK | Thu, 9 Jan @ 09:50 | Wed, 15 Jan @ 22:30 | Norwegian | ¬£233\n\n\n## Useful travel tip\n\nOther than the usual Googling around for things to do, an app which I find very useful when abroad is Foursquare. For those of you who remember running around and tagging locations as well as recommending new places, you'll be surprised at some of the local knowledge in there. You'll be able to avoid the more touristic spots and find the more local places to hang out. Just be aware that as it is mostly user generated, some places have since closed down, but the ones that remain are for the most part very good :-)\n\n----\n\nThat's it guys, hope you enjoy the flights and make the most of it !!!",

    "text": "As a die-hard one-bagger, I never give booking budget airlines a second thought. The advertised price is what it is, and that works just fine for me. Personal-item, 7kg, under the seat in front of me: never a problem. Middle seat? Who cares. Pay for meal? Sure, if I'm hungry and something looks good, but I might bring a snack along.\n\nAnd then Pegasus came along with their latest policies (in February): **3kg** personal item only. This number just seems so absurdly low (is there *anyone* who can really travel that light for more than a daytrip? My laptop, which I need for work, weighs half that!), that it's getting under my skin a bit.  It's the principle of the matter here: advertising a fare that no one can actually get away with without serious inconvenience. I get that luggage *is* how a lot of these airlines make most of their money -- but at least with the Wizz Airs of the world you can comfortably fly without paying for any of the extras, and without breaking the rules.\n\nAnyway, I haven't hopped on this flight yet, but I did buy one Pegasus ticket. And I actually, for the first time in my life, made a conscious choice to avoid them on another flight -- because of principle (and, sure, options).\n\nI'm also determined to stay under the 3kg limit. From what I've read, it seems like they've actually been enforcing it regularly (because hell, pretty much every bag will be over 3kg and they know it). I'm not one to sweat this kind of stuff or break out all the stops, but I do also enjoy a good challenge.  Even if it means walking up to the gate with extra layers on and very full pockets...\n\nAnyway...apologies for the rant!  Curious if others have been successful on Pegasus lately -- or if there's any other airline in the world that's this restrictive!",

    "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nSo I just flew out of Abu Dhabi quite recently. Just a word of caution to everyone that they are VERY STRICT when it comes to carry on limitations. They wouldn‚Äôt let me clear immigration until my baggage was 7 kg to the dot. This is ridiculous as I have never experiences this even in the most LCCs of airlines which include Ryan Air and Wizz Air. I had to throw a couple of my things out + wore all my shirts on top of one another to circumvent this. They were also fussy about my backpack which had my laptop and iPad on it like do you expect me to throw this away or what? To add to the pain they also check your baggage in the gate (???)\n\nI think this sort of attitude is unacceptable as Etihad is mostly charging a premium. They market themselves as a first-tier, full-service airline and yet this is how petty they are towards carry on. It would be understandable if I had paid lower fees, but the fact is I paid more with Etihad when I could‚Äôve gotten much less with Qatar or Emirates, and their baggage allowance is 30-40 kg if you are a student. There were many other passengers who had to throw their stuff out too and mind you this was 1 AM IN THE MORNING! This was NOT a random check. The guy before immigration checked every single passenger. There was a size and weighting scale right before immigration. \n\nMy first experience with Etihad has been a nightmare so far, and flying with them just to see Abu Dhabi has not been worth it. I will avoid like the plague in the future. \n\nAnyone has any thoughts why Etihad is literally pissing off passengers to not fly with them?",

What does it take for our army to lose fewer battles? \n\nThey need modern and precise weapons, while professional soldiers should be retrained. They must be properly prepared. Do not spare ammunition during the exercises. \n\nThere must be a plan; adventurous commanders should not be allowed to sacrifice soldiers. \n\nSince 50 of the 29 shaheeds are officers *[outdated data]*, that means the theory that we had sent unprepared soldiers cannot be true.\n\nSo how did our army, while fighting against a demoralized, ill-equipped, and poor enemy, sustain so many casualties within just a few hours? Can we assume we have 3-4 times as many wounded? So many losses, yet nothing was gained. The authorities cannot ignore these issues by being silent. We expect an explanation from Aliyev. //\n\n[source,](https://www.civilnet.am/news/675055/’´’∂’π’∏’û÷Ç-’°’µ’§÷Ñ’°’∂-’∑’°’ø-’∂’°’∞’°’ø’°’Ø-’ø’æ’•÷Å’´’∂÷Ñ-’Ω’∏’æ’°’Æ-’©’∑’∂’°’¥’∏÷Ç-’§’•’¥-’¥’´-÷Ñ’°’∂’´-’™’°’¥’æ’°-’¥’°÷Ä’ø’∏÷Ç’¥‚Ä§-’°’§÷Ä’¢’•’ª’°’∂÷Å’´-’®’∂’§’§’´’¥’°’§’´÷Ä-’°’º’°’ª’∂’∏÷Ä’§/)\n\n\n##Armenian opposition figure: in some directions, our soldiers were not brought to combat readiness prior to the attack \n\n**Reporter:** Do you see any frontline improvement since last year? Last year, after the deployment in new areas, in many locations we had no soldiers yet. Shepherds would occasionally encounter an enemy on the border. \n\n**PU MP Tigran Abrahamyan:** Yes, certain problems have been addressed in several directions. Our soldiers displayed heroism in multiple directions. The problem is that several bases were not brought to combat state prior to the attack. These soldiers were not deployed to the frontlines despite information about a possible attack. Some of the soldiers were asleep. It doesn't matter now if it was due to poor intel or poor command. If you see enemy accumulations, you should be ready. Even if the army leadership doesn't send an order, local commanders have the authority to bring them to combat readiness. \n\n**Reporter:** We had a similar problem in April 2016, about the troops not being fully ready. At the time, the explanation was that although it was known that the enemy could attack at any moment, it was dragged for so long that the forces let their guard down. If that \"any moment\" starts to look \"permanent\", can you keep your forces in special regimes for so long? \n\n**Abrahamyan:** In vulnerable times, various regimes can be used. In 2016 the intel told us that diversionary activities are possible in various directions. The command took steps in those directions. It's another thing that the intel failed to uncover the true scale of the planned \"diversionary activities\". \n\n[source,](https://youtu.be/SwmzhHXhayA)\n\n\n\n##Azerbaijan has not captured any settlements, the battles were near positions: Parliament Speaker \n\n**Reporter:** Yesterday Pashinyan announced that Azerbaijan invaded 10 km^2 during the aggression, in addition to the ~40 km^2 they had invaded last year. Does this include settlements?\n\n**Speaker Simonyan:** The territories do not include any settlements. The main battles were near the positions. There were positional changes. Our soldiers were able to recapture some of the lost positions, while in other places Azeri managed to succeed. //\n\n##... battles and territorial changes \n\nAzeri forces invaded a territory near the border village Nerkin Hand. Since the enemy is too close to the village, women and children had to be evacuated. Male residents remain in the village, armed with rifles. \n\n---\n\n**Reporter:** What's the status in Ishkhanasar direction? The media reported that some positions were lost. Were we able to recover any?\n\n**Goris mayor:** Yes, there were some losses, there were some gains, a few meters back and forth. The most important thing is to fight and stand for our territorial integrity. We need to strike preemptively. //\n\n---\n\n**Ex-Premier Aram Sargsyan:** Had Armenia possessed modern weapons, the battles would have been in the territory of Azerbaijan by now. Our soldiers displayed heroism. After Azeri groups attempted to infiltrate the border - you've seen [one of the videos](https://youtu.be/RCypI9xQ8DQ?t=4) - our forces took measures to stop them. Azeris then used artillery. Armenia responded with artillery fire as well; they've done an excellent job with it, ask anyone who was present on the border. Azeris, after realizing they weren't succeeding, began using GRAD missiles. We responded with GRAD fire, damaging an Azeri military base. Seeing they are unable to win in an equal fight, they ramped up the use of drones and other modern weapons.\n\nPashinyan [revealed on Tuesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/xdigh2/sep132022_military_aggression_by_azerbaijan/) that after becoming Premier, the military gave him a list of weapons worth $12 billion, to which he agreed. After the 2020 war, I encouraged them to acquire 120 drones worth $100 million from India. On Tuesday Pashinyan revealed why that wasn't possible. He brought up 4 reasons, with which agree, but he didn't reveal the 5th and most important reason. There are countries that are willing to sell us modern weapons and anti-drone weapons. Even the U.S., during the 2020 war, had agreed to sell us radiolocation stations. But Russia, whom Pashinyan mentioned under reason-2 without giving its name, had threatened Armenia that if it buys weapons from the U.S., they won't deliver artillery shells to Armenia. There are also weapons that the West won't sell to us unless we leave CSTO. //\n\n[source,](https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1092621.html)\n[source,](https://factor.am/555003.html)\n[source,](https://www.panarmenian.net/arm/news/302539/)\n[source,](https://youtu.be/r73Ztl8WcHI?t=334)\n[source,](https://youtu.be/j7-GITChV2E?t=596)\n\n\n\n##Russia wants Azerbaijan to return its troops to initial positions \n\n**Foreign Ministry of Russia:** Our military is in close contact with both sides to achieve a stable ceasefire and return the Azerbaijani and Armenian troops to their initial positions.\n\n[source,](https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1092625.html)\n\n\n\n##Ireland calls any violation of territorial integrity \"unacceptable\", and urges troops to withdraw to initial positions \n\n**Ireland's UN Security Council rep.:** It is vital that the sides exercise maximum restraint and refrain from a further escalation in violence.

Pashinyan accused Armenia-based opposition of intentionally distorting his words to claim he will soon sign an unfavorable document to surrender Nagorno Karabakh or give Azerbaijan a \"corridor\". Karabakh administration contacted Pashinyan to clarify it was a misunderstanding. They sent a delegation to Yerevan today.\n\n**Nagorno Karabakh President Harutyunyan:** The leadership of Armenia keeps me informed in detail about all the international discussions on the Artsakh [Nagorno Karabakh] issue. Joint consultations are held regularly. We have an agreement that any document would need to take into account the Artsakh authorities' opinion. Under this context, there is not even a process to draft such a document. //\n\n---\n\n**Ioannesian, Informed Citizens NGO:** During last night's opposition protest in front of parliament, Pashinyan invited me and several other public figures and analysts for a meeting. We held a constructive and honest discussion on various topics. \n\nI'd like to emphasize that there was no mention of signing any \"document\" or anything. Pashinyan could have formulated his words better in parliament, but certain media outlets took them out of context and exaggerated it. We all know what happened next. \n\n[Conspiracy theorist blogger Vardan Ghukasyan] made up a claim and helped spread it. It's truly sad that our society's media literacy is so low that [Vardan Ghokasyan] is the news source. //\n\n---\n\nArmenia-based opposition parties continued to accuse Pashinyan of \"treason\" on Thursday. They held a protest yesterday, during which there were attempts to take down the gates in front of the parliament building.\n\n**Ruling MP Papoyan:** The false claims [about a \"document\"] circulated after Pashinyan's Wednesday speech was a media terror and needs a legal evaluation. Only an enemy collaborator can do such a thing. It was clearly meant to weaken our soldiers' morale. We have been informed that certain people contacted provincial settlements yesterday and told them that a treacherous document is going to be signed within the next 5 minutes, *\"come to Yerevan, fight here\"*. This was an attempt to open the second front against Armenia, at a time when our soldiers were fighting well, and fulfilling their duties. I believe our public needs better media literacy so it can repel the manipulations. //\n\n**Oppo MP Gegham Manukyan:** People who gathered in front of the parliament building yesterday were not sent there by us. Thousands of people are concerned about their country. They forced Pashinyan to clarify his words about signing a document, and yet they still haven't denied it fully. //\n\n**Ruling MP Vahagn Alexanyan:** Here is the timeline of events yesterday. Our soldiers were able to score a series of successes on the battlefield - modest successes but nevertheless successes. This was followed by Pashinyan declaring in Parliament that Armenia will not give a Syunik corridor to Azerbaijan. The opposition, which is being controlled and financed by centers located outside of Armenia, proceeded to launch a disinformation terror campaign to open a second front against our soldiers. They cut a minute-long clip from Pashinyan's speech and presented it out of context to claim \"a document is about to be signed\". They hired a few actors to upload videos in which they cry, but when you look at them closely, there is not a single drop of tear, because even here the opposition embezzled the funds that were meant to hire decent actors. Glory to our soldiers for standing strong. //\n\nThings eventually got heated in parliament. A confrontation erupted between the ruling and opposition parties. The opposition said it will proceed with an impeachment process that they have been planning for several weeks. The ruling party MP said the impeachment will fail because the ruling MPs won't vote in favor.\n\nA ruling party MP suggested for the opposition to send its supporters to defend the borders instead of carrying out a \"coup\", and urged for the gathered able-bodied men to be drafted immediately. The opposition criticized the MP. When asked to comment, the authorities denied any plans to draft the protesters.\n\n[source,](https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1092555.html)\n[source,](https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1092579.html)\n[source,](https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1092580.html)\n[source,](https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1092581.html)\n[source,](https://armenpress.am/eng/news/1092605.html)\n[source,](https://armenpress.am/arm/news/1092613.html)\n[video,](https://youtu.be/ogubTxW6xKY?t=92)\n[video,](https://youtu.be/FBOud9LK4rw?t=113)\n[video,](https://factor.am/554667.html)\n[video,](https://youtu.be/5t7IVt5ti9U)\n[video,](https://youtu.be/ivSBClp0C3Y?t=28)\n[video,](https://youtu.be/syWo1bAHrK0?t=58)\n[relevant,](https://www.armtimes.com/hy/article/244104)\n[source,](https://www.civilnet.am/news/674938/’∫’∂-’∂-’¥’•’Ø’∂’°’¢’°’∂’•’¨-’ß-’∞’°’∂÷Ä’°’∞’°’æ’°÷Ñ’´-’¥’°’Ω’∂’°’Ø’´÷Å’∂’•÷Ä’´’∂-’Ω’°’∞’¥’°’∂-’∏÷Ç’≤’°÷Ä’Ø’•’¨’∏÷Ç-’¨’∏÷Ç÷Ä’•÷Ä’®/)\n[source,](https://www.armtimes.com/hy/article/244131)\n[source,](https://www.armtimes.com/hy/article/244131)\n\n\n\n##U.S. is rotating its diplomats between Ukraine, Armenia, and Russia  \n\nU.S. ambassador Lynne Tracy will end her duties in Armenia, as announced in June.

It's the Government's turn to nominate a judge.\n\nThe Government has nominated a prominent pro-Western lawyer Seda Safaryan. She became publically famous after representing \"March 1st\" victims against the Kocharyan regime. Safaryan joined the pro-Western Babajanyan-Shirinyan alliance to run against Pashinyan's QP party during the 2021 parliamentary elections.\n\n**MP:** Can you update us on the March 1 situation? The charges were dropped from [Kocharyan & co] because they were charged under an article that was written \"poorly\", as others have claimed.\n\n**Candidate Seda Safaryan:** It wasn't necessarily about the article being weak. It was also because certain charges were not pressed. I don't know why the prosecutor decided to press only \"toppling the constitution\" charges. But Armenia has a new Prosecutor General today, so the March 1st approach could change. The March 1st case is not closed. There is a pending case in the Cassations Court. Another case is being investigated by the Investigative Committee separately. //\n\nSerj-era judge Ashot Khachatryan's term is also ending. It was the President's turn to nominate a judge. He nominated Hovakim Hovakimyan. \n\nThe Parliament voted to approve both judges.

One of the MPs, overseeing the voting process, had to suspend her activities and leave the room. The Parliament speaker Alen Simonyan criticized the reporters for the disruption and asked the security agents to escort the reporters out.

Aveam la activ vreo 40 de zboruri cu ei, peste tot prin Europa si n-am avut probleme.. pana acum. Am zis ca mai merge un city break, de weekend. \n\nVineri, dupa vreo 90min de intarziere in urma unor erori pe un computer de bord la cursa de pe Otopeni, intorsi fiind din avion, am reusit sa plecam spre Praga (au venit baietii de la tehnic cu un laptop, imi si imaginam cum au sters ei eroarea si au dat restart, case-closed).\n\nDuminica seara, cursa anuntata la ora 22:30 din Praga, spre Otopeni, a fost devansata pe la ora 21 de vreo doua ori, succesiv, pana aproape de 4 dimineata, cu mesaj pe telefon, mail si notificare in aplicatie. In aeroport, la biroul de check-in lumea bulversata, evident, multi se plangeau cum cu o saptamana in urma se anulasera atat cursa de duminica, cat si cea de luni.\n\nPana la urma, cei 2 angajatii Wizz, de la ghiseu, ne anunta ca cursa va fi reprogramata pentru azi la ora 15 si ca vom primi vouchere de mancare si cazare peste noapte la un hotel. Cu prezenta de spirit si avand nevoie urgenta sa ajung inapoi in tara ASAP, am luat rapid alte bilete pentru cursa Tarom de azi dimineata, cost 300‚Ç¨, doua persoane, costuri asumate stiind ca alte variante nu exista (mai era o varianta cu Austrian Airlines, dar cu escala si foarte scumpa). Am recomandat si celorlalti romani, care aveau posibilitati, sa faca la fel, dar din ce am vazut azi, doar cativa au mai apucat, zborul Tarom fiind fully booked.\n\nNe-au cazat la hotel de 4 stele, super profi, am avut inclusa si cina si micul dejun, la discretie, fara sa dam niciun ban in plus, pana aici nimic asa grav de reprosat. Noi am avut noroc ca am avut inca valabil biletul de transport in comun (24h) si am putut utiliza autobuzul din aeroport + metrou pana la hotel, deci cumva amanarea ne-ar fi costat doar o zi de concediu.\n\nAstazi ajung in tara cu Tarom, toate bune, in jur de pranz, iar cu 2h si un pic inainte de zborul initial Wizz, reprogramat la 15:40, neprimind nicio veste noua de la ei, intru de curiozitate in aplicatia lor sa vad ce s-a intamplat si imi dau seama ca am fost foarte inspirat aseara sa nu ma mai incred in acesti jepcari. \n\nPersonal, n-o sa mai aleg Wizz prea curand, dar imi pare nespus de rau pentru ceilalti pasageri care au avut speranta ca astazi se pot intoarce acasa. De la Wizz sigur nu au mai pupat nicio despagubire, iar pana la noi vesti, \"check the airport monitors and stay alert\"..",

    "text": "So I recently got an amazing discount for Patagonia Refugio 30l in the bestest ever colorway (Agave plum gray), and it felt like it would be the perfect 7-10 day bag. I use an Ikea Forenkla roltop (long discontinued but the best ever big bag) for longer travels, and it is the perfect long travel bag, but it's a bit too bulky for shorter trips. \n \nThis will be a family vacation and I'm carrying a bit more than I would going solo, just because of my mum will be bothering me that I brought only 3 shirts. \n\nSome additional info, first time trying mesh produce bags from the shop as packing cubes, and they work amazingly good. And they're stupidly cheap.\n\nOnto the packing list:\n\n[Before, badly knolled](https://i.imgur.com/b5pPARW.jpg)\n\n\n* Bag: Patagonia Refugio 30l:\n * Love this bag. Picked it up as an ECD short travel bag, and it the perfect blend of urban EDC bag, and a hiking day pack. I love that it half opens so you can lay it and pack it almost as a suitcase. And I love that it stands up. It's nice and roomy, and has good structure. The load lifters help a lot when packing and carrying it. Quality is great. and IMHO, the price is justified even if you don't get it on discount.  \n\n* The rest:\n * Clothes:\n     * T-shirts (3 fancy cotton ones, 3 EDC polyester workout ones, sleep shirt, backup wool shirt)\n     * Bottoms (2 travel shorts, workout quick dry shorts, 2 swim trunks)\n     * Underwear (5 pairs of running underwear)\n     * Rash-guard (for snorkeling and sun protection, ION sun shirt)\n     * Running cap (thin and UPF50, Asics Lyte Cap)\n     * Sandals (for walking to the beach and back, Teva Classics)\n     * Bison Last Chance belt\n * Electronics:\n     * Xiaomi 35W quick charger\n     * 2x cables\n     * Universal travel adapter \n     * GoPro Hero 9 with dive housing\n     * Underwater handle for GoPro\n     * Phillips true wireless earbuds\n     * Xiaomi 20000 battery\n * Misc: \n     * Packable backpack (random one off Ali-Express, works great and it's still in one piece)\n     * Packable bum bag (Decathlon)\n     * Mask and snorkel (Cressi Calibro, and flexible snorkel, I like to use my own mask when travelling for snorkelling and scubadiving, and this is my backup mask but I love that it's super compact and durable)\n     * Water bottle (gas station tritan bottle) \n     * Two packable beach towells\n     * Eyeglasses case\n * Toiletries (packed in a ziplock bag):\n     * Avene mineral 50+ UPF creme (gotta protect that rosacea nose)\n     * Bioderma sensitive skin moisturizer\n     * Travel sized q-tips\n     * Tootbrush\n     * Painkillers (I carry them always since I'm allergic to painkillers and can't risk of trying out unknown painkillers elswhere, so 4-5 tablets of codeine are always with me)\n     * Allergy medication\n     * Foam earplugs\n     * UPF chapstick\n\n[After, nicely packed](https://i.imgur.com/pVjuVPU.jpg)\n\nI'm surprised how it all well packed. The laptop/water bladder pocket is great for putting folded up pants. If I don't bring my laptop there is no need to bing the laptop sleeve that comes with the bag, so that's extra space. The standouts are the mesh produce bags. Totally recommend it. \n\nAnd also massive recommendation for the bag.\n\n\n**POST TRAVEL UPDATE:**\n\nOK, so this bag is amazing. After 7 days of travel, I thought I packed it quite full, but no. I guess there is still room for souvenirs. :D The bag is really comfortable to wear fully loaded. And the amount of stuff you can get in it is amazing. It feels much roomier than 30l on the inside, while being quite compact  on the outside. The bungee was really helpful to strap the snorkeling fins I got, the laptop compartment was great to put any pants I didn't want to roll and some literature I got while traveling. The Lycra pockets are massive. I managed to fit two bottles (1l + 0.5l) in one easily. The build quality is absurd, and the colorway is the best. I thought that it will stain easy, but it's still stain free. And the best thing I notice, It stands upright when you put it down. It's not toppling on any site. It will fit as a personal item under a Wizz Air seat no problem. and the shoulder straps, when you undo the load lifters lie flat with the back, and there are no straps poking out, minimizing the snags when putting it in overhead compartments. \n\nSubjectively, it carries more and better than my 45l carry-on suitcase I have. And it's easier to lug it around for shorter trips compared to my Ikea Forenkla backpack, which although is rated as a 35l, fits 45-50l easily w/o any problems. \n\nTL;DR; I love this bag, It's one of the best impulsive purchases I did. I highly recommend it if you wanna add some patagucci to your life.",

    "title": "Advice on how to force Wizz Air UK to pay you Reg (EC) 261/2004 compensation for severe delay or cancellation. I successfully sued Wizz Air - and won!",
    "text": "I had an absolutely horrific experience with Wizz Air on both my inbound and outbound flights in September 2022. But, I'm writing this post in the hope that I can help others to recover their money from these scam artists.\n\nMy outbound flight from London Gatwick (LGW) to Tel Aviv (TLV) on the 9th of September 2022 (at 13:45) was cancelled once everyone was past security and had been waiting for hours after the flight being listed as delayed. Finally, several hours after the flight was meant to depart - text messaged were sent out informing us that it had been cancelled. We were called to a gate where a representative of Wizz Air was rude, unhelpful and dismissive and offered us no real support. She informed us simply to \"check the website\" and that we would get 600 EUR compensation. This situation left me stranded in London and I was forced to spend around ¬£140 on a hotel and local transportation with no assistance whatsoever from Wizz Air. As there was no alternative Wizz Air flight for the next few days to change to, I had to spend a further ¬£320 to switch to a Virgin Atlantic flight the following evening from London Heathrow (LHR). I was essentially left stranded with absolutely no support from Wizz Air, which they are legally required to provide under article 9 (right to care) of Reg (EC) 261/2004.\n\nTo make matters even worse, my inbound flight from Tel Aviv (TLV) to London Gatwick (LGW) on the 19th of September 2022 (at 21:50, Israeli time) was delayed nearly 23 hours in the end - apparently due to lack of cabin staff! What made things worse was that during the day of the flight was changed back and forth five times (to 23:20, 22:43, 00:25, 23:48, 01:25) throughout the day causing lots of confusion. Finally, to add insult to injury - once everyone was past security and standing at the gate - we all received a text message at 22:46 informing us that the flight would be delayed until 13:00 the following day. There were no representatives of Wizz Air in the airport and airport staff organised a hotel for us (free of charge) but we had to cover the costs of our own taxis (which came to ¬£55 each way). The following morning there was another notification informing us that the flight was delayed until 19:00. In the end the flight left at 20:15, the day after it was supposed to depart at 21:50. Staff were incredibly rude and not understanding at all of customers being upset. They only offered us water and peanuts which they had the nerve to charge us for as apparently there was \"no catering in Tel Aviv airport\" (clearly they didn't want people claiming a full meal back from them). \n\nTo give you some legal context, under Reg (EC) 261/2004 ([https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2004/261/contents](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2004/261/contents)), an airline is liable to pay you compensation for cancellation (except in 'extraordinary circumstances' or a significant delay. This amount varies between ¬£220 and ¬£520 depending on distance/length of delay. They also are legally required to pay for any expenses incurred due to delay/cancellation including: cost of alternative flight, food and drink, local transportation and hotel accommodation.\n\nWhen I returned home, I thought it would be as simple as just listing my expenses covered under (EC) 261/2004 and the amount of compensation owed and that I'd maybe be waiting a month or two and get what the law states I'm entitled to without much of a fight. How wrong was I! It turns out you can fill in 4 separate claim forms (one each for expenses, one each for compensation) and they will simply ignore them and take well over the supposed 30 day limit to respond to you. All I initially received was the original value of the flight as Wizz credits that I was unable to withdraw. \n\nThe only one which was answered the following day was one stating that they cancelled my outbound due to weather and that no compensation was owed. It took months before they replied to the expenses claim for the outbound flight and they simply offered to pay the fare difference but dismissed all other expenses as 'consequential expenses' (including the hotel, transport between hotel and airports and food/drink). I repeatedly protested this in my responses to the customer service agent dealing with the claim, mentioned that I still had two other claims pending which were being ignored and she just avoided responding to the issues in the email chain. I eventually received the fare difference in December. Multiple complaint forms were sent in, I phoned customer care (at ¬£1.45/min who were useless) and continuously emailed and nothing seemed to help. All I got in the end without suing was the hotel cost added on after lots of arguing.\n\nAs a result of their inaction, I decided to initiate legal action in the small claims court in December. This is a much simpler process than I thought it would be and does not require a lawyer. [https://www.gov.uk/make-court-claim-for-money](https://www.gov.uk/make-court-claim-for-money) . It's a fairly simple process and all you need to do is fill in the expenses owed (and ideally relate them to the relevant sections of Reg (EC) 261/2004) and leave brief notes and explain your situation briefly on the cover page. Just remember to specify that who you are suing is \"Wizz Air UK Ltd.\" and their address is \"Wizz Air UK Ltd, Main Terminal Building, London Luton Airport, LU2 9LY, Luton\".\n\nOn the 20th of December 2022, a County Court Judgement was made against Wizz Air UK. It was actually made by default after they didn't respond during the mandated 21 days. There might be a delay due to slow postal services in you receiving this as you are notified by post. At this point, any decent company would immediately organise to pay the balance of the order in full - but Wizz Air seem to think that ignoring customer emails and legal rulings are the best way to not pay out and avoid their legal obligations.\n\nAs a matter of fact, they are absolutely notorious for this: \n\n[https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/experts/article-11446965/TONY-HETHERINGTON-airline-flying-law-Wizz-Air-UK.html](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/experts/article-11446965/TONY-HETHERINGTON-airline-flying-law-Wizz-Air-UK.html)\n\n[https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/experts/article-11471955/TONY-HETHERINGTON-Wizz-Air-braced-court-orders.html](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/experts/article-11471955/TONY-HETHERINGTON-Wizz-Air-braced-court-orders.html)\n\n[https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/holidays/article-11776667/Complaints-backlog-thats-Wizz-Air-Britains-hated-airline.html](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/holidays/article-11776667/Complaints-backlog-thats-Wizz-Air-Britains-hated-airline.html)\n\nHaving a County Court Judgement against them does not guarantee they will pay out. At this point, enforcement options become necessary. The logical thing initially would be to send the bailiffs into their address at London Luton Airport. However, this simply does not work. All of Wizz Air's assets in the UK are on lease and so the court cannot seize them as they simply state \"we have no physical presence in the UK\".\n\n[https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/regulator-slams-unacceptable-wizz-air-behaviour-b2246893.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/regulator-slams-unacceptable-wizz-air-behaviour-b2246893.html)\n\nThe smart move at this point, is to use your County Court Judgement to apply for a Third Party Debt Order. Wizz Air may not have any physical assets in the UK in a legal sense... but they do have a banking presence. A Third Party Debt Order essentially involves officers of the court going to the defendant's bank and demanding to know the account number and sort codes of all bank accounts the defendant has with them and if there are sufficient funds in any of them to cover the County Court Judgement and any legal fees. At this point the value of the order and legal fees are frozen out of their bank account and the date for a hearing is set.\n\nIn my case, Wizz Air contacted me 6 days after their funds were frozen on the 30th of January 2023 and paid the money into my account within 3 days! I had to force their hand to meet their legal obligations but they paid out almost instantly after I'd frozen their money! What makes it even more funny is that my order was ¬£1,338 and they paid my that without factoring in they'd already paid around ¬£460 - so I benefited off their atrocious admin!\n\nHere is some information on how to apply for a Third Party Debt Order to recover money from Wizz Air:\n\nTheir banking assets are with Citibank NA (London Branch) - as evidenced here: [https://wizzair.com/en-gb/information-and-services/booking-information/payments/how-to-make-a-bank-transfer](https://wizzair.com/en-gb/information-and-services/booking-information/payments/how-to-make-a-bank-transfer) . Do not fill in the account number and sort code in the form as the officers of the court can find out all accounts they have with Citibank. Use this address for Citibank: \"Citibank N.A. London Branch, 33 Canada Square, Canary Wharf, London, E14 5LB\".\n\nThe court address you must send it to (being closest to Wizz Air's UK headquarters) is here: [https://www.find-court-tribunal.service.gov.uk/courts/luton-justice-centre](https://www.find-court-tribunal.service.gov.uk/courts/luton-justice-centre)\n\n[https://www.gov.uk/make-court-claim-for-money/enforce-a-judgment](https://www.gov.uk/make-court-claim-for-money/enforce-a-judgment)\n\n[https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\\_data/file/726426/ex325-eng.pdf](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/726426/ex325-eng.pdf)\n\n[https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\\_data/file/958283/n349-eng.pdf](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/958283/n349-eng.pdf)\n\nMy main recommendation would be to simply never fly with them. I've flown with them before and it's  been nothing but trouble (albeit not to this extent) every time. They may be significantly cheaper than other airlines but you end up paying so much more in the end between their various scams and atrocious service. This is a company that simply hides behind poor customer service and slow response times in order to get out of their legal obligations.\n\nIf anyone in a similar situation with this awful airline would like any advice, I'd be more than happy to help!",

    "text": "We are a couple in our 70‚Äôs paid fees to obtain the Scotiabank Passport Visa Card specifically for its travel insurance benefits covers flight cancellation and interruptions.¬†\n\nOn October 4, our Wizz Air flight from Budapest to Amman, Jordan, was canceled two days before departure, including the return flight. We were supposed to stay in Jordan for eight days. We also had to vacate our hotel room in Budapest and were literally stranded there, leaving us no choice but to book a one-way return flight from Budapest to Toronto.\n\nUpon arrival in Toronto, we filed a claim for cancellation with Manulife, who handles Scotiabank Visa insurance claims, providing all the supporting documents. On October 24, 2024, we received an email from Global ¬†Excel Management Claims adjuster, denying our claim, stating that outright cancellations are not covered.\n\nWe would appreciate any assistance or suggestions on how to recover the expenses.\n\nThank you.\nEdit:Jordan airspace suddenly closed because Iran fire missiles at Israel. \nWizz Air did reimbursed for flight cancellation. We were supposed to fly back from Barcelona to Toronto with Air Transat which we missed. ",

      "What did the airline give you back for the cancellation? If the airline cancelled it they would need to reimburse or you request a chargeback on the card because they didn‚Äôt provide the service you paid for. \n\nThe card cancellation is typically additional costs between that amount you‚Äôre reimbursed and the new ticket price to get home, etc. pull up the terms and read through it",
      "Why was the original flight cancelled?\n\nTrip cancellation insurance only includes cancelling for certain specific reasons.  So if the airline didn't give a reason, then I can understand why your claim was denied.\n\nEdit:  from your insurance certificate: \n\n>The outright cancellation of Common Carrier travel is not considered a delay. The benefit under this Cause for Cancellation is the Insured Person‚Äôs one-way economy fare via the most cost-effective route to the Insured Person‚Äôs next destination;\n\nYou also should have called them immediately when the flight was cancelled.\n\nYou would have been covered had you booked a flight from Budapest to Jordan, I believe.  But not a flight from Budapest to Toronto.\n\nSince you were aware that the return flight was also cancelled, you would have probably wanted to contact them and confirm that booking an alternate return flight as well would be covered.",
      "Hi, just a reminder that since Wizz is a European carrier, you may qualify for EU261 comp, *in addition to flight refund*. Please double check the eligibility.",
      "I am sorry to hear of this annoyance, which is a massive one. However:\n\n(1) Wizz cancelled your flights two days before departure. Wasn't there an economic way of reaching Amman on the designated day or a bit later?\n\n(2) You were supposed to stay in Jordan for eight days. The fact that you forsook the entirety of that trip, despite the fact that there may have been a cost-effective way to reach Amman, is a factor against your claim for the Jordan portion of the trip.\n\nBeyond the card insurance, take action under EU 261 for both the outbound and the returning flight.",
      "You can and should get reimbursed by Wizz, but your other costs, probably can't be recovered. This unfortunately the correct call by the insurance company. \n\nThe first call to make in case of cancellation is to your insurance company that covers any travel delays and find out what your options are. \n\nThey likely would have advised finding alternate flight(s) to Jordan and resuming your trip, which in all likelihood would have been covered or if they may have booked you home if you couldn't find alternate travel arrangements - but that would be after they had done everything they could to get you to your next destination."

    "text": "More of a rant tbh. \n\nIn my time I‚Äôve worked in two of London‚Äôs airports and flown out of four of them + Bristol. \n\nHaving always driven past (even plane spotted a few times) Cardiff Airport, I‚Äôve always wondered why (a) it‚Äôs not been properly invested in; (b) why it‚Äôs not as popular as it should. \n\nI know that KLM Cityflyer as well as TUI bucket and spade trips tend to make up most of CWL‚Äôs traffic. It was disappointing to see Wizz Air pull out. \n\nWhile I can appreciate that transport links aren‚Äôt amazing, they aren‚Äôt worse than what you‚Äôd find at Bristol. (I actually think travelling from Rumney to Bristol Airport was worse than simply going to the airport on my doorstep.)\n\nIf WG ignored the NIMBYs and just built a proper rail link + station (shutting down Rhoose station at it) that would be nice.",

      "During the summer period the same destination flights and the same airlines are nearly half the price from Bristol than Cardiff so alot of people choose Bristol.",
      "Cardiff and Bristol airport used to be on a somewhat equal footing - then a company bought Cardiff airport as part of a larger deal in order to get another airport (possibly Luton iirc) however they had no interest in growing Cardiff airport so it was left to fall by the wayside.\neventually the Welsh government stepped in and initially did a pretty good job at growing passenger numbers, they were almost up to 2 million - and then COVID hit and smaller airports were decimated, so we begin the task of growing the passenger numbers again.\npassenger numbers are everything. more passengers means more flights, cheaper flights and makes improvement in the infrastructure more viable too, which all means more passenger numbers.",
      "Public transport wise the links are much worse. Bristol airport flyer has a bus every 10 minutes from one of the best served train stations in the UK and from a bus station. Where as to get into Cardiff there is a bus that meets a specific train that runs every half hour from a station that is only served by that one train.\n\nAlso the catchment of Bristol Airport has many many more people than the catchment of Cardiff - this is compounded by most of Cardiff's catchment also living in Bristol's catchment so it's always going to struggle to out compete. As an airline why fly into Cardiff when you can have the same customers and more flying into Bristol?",
      "I grew up in west Wales, where with an already 2 hour long journey to Cardiff, the extra hour to Bristol really made Cardiff airport more attractive. This sometimes meant we were willing to pay a little more for the convenience of a shorter drive to the airport.\n\nLiving in Cardiff now, it's just as easy to get to Bristol as it is to get to Rhoose, so choosing cheaper options makes more sense. \n\nThe trouble is that the population west of Swansea probably isn't big enough to sustain an airport. In order to be viable Cardiff needs to be a more attractive option for customers than Bristol, their proximity to each other makes them competitors. \n\nIt could be that a proper rail link would make it more attractive than the rail & shuttle bus option that Bristol currently had. That itself is really costly to implement, especially when it's not guaranteed to work. \nAnother option would be to try to attract airlines that otherwise wouldn't fly to Bristol. The long runway at Cardiff makes it more attractive for larger planes, but airlines won't come unless there are enough customers to profit.\n\nUltimately, I think it's unviable in it's current form, but it will probably cost too much to make it viable, and the investment still might not work.",
      "If I could get on a train at Llanishen directly to Cardiff Airport, I would definitely look at using it more. However, the destinations I go to when not needing Heathrow all go from Bristol, for incredibly cheap, and regularly (Barcelona, Amsterdam, Copenhagen for example - in the past I even flew direct to New York from Bristol for like ¬£175 return)... I did fly to Amsterdam from Cardiff once on KLM, and from what I remember it was insanely expensive and a terrible time of day. I literally don't get why Cardiff airport doesn't look at Bristol and go \"right, let's do that\". I get there's Roose train station, but do they have a free shuttle bus every 10 mins for example? If they can't get a train line direct to the airport it's little things like that which would make a difference."
