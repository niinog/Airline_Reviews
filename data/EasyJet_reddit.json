When they arrived on the runway, they accelerated directly out of the turn without even slowing down. Is this normal and even legal? I don't fly very often, but it was the only time I experienced this. In my experience planes always stop on the runway before accelerating, does anybody know why they didn't in this case? It might have just been the pilot's style, as he also already left the runway very early when we were still quite fast after landing.",

This clearance is issued to improve runway efficiency and separation between aircraft. Upon receiving this clearance, the pilot is expected to taxi onto the runway and begin the takeoff immediately, either from a holding point or while already on the runway.*",

This allows ATC to close the gaps between landings/take-offs = more traffic = more money\n\nEdit: To add to this, in the UK I've also got \"Cleared for T/O Rwy 26L no delay\" which is basically the same call",

    "title": "Flug 10min vor Abflug annulliert - selbstständig Ersatz gebucht - wie vorgehen?",
    "text": "Hallo zusammen, \n\nIch entschuldige mich schonmal, denn dieser Post könnte etwas länger werden. \n\nMeine Freundin und ich waren das Wochenende über in Mailand und hatten für Sonntagabend 18:50 Uhr einen Rückflug nach Düsseldorf mit EasyJet gebucht. Wir waren frühzeitig am Flughafen (15:30) und haben gegen 16:00 Uhr unseren Koffer beim Self Drop Off abgegeben. Dort erschien dann auf der Anzeige die Mitteilung, dass der Flug 22min Verspätung hat und um 19:12 starten wird. \n\nWir haben dann über die Website von EasyJet den Flugstatus überprüft und festgestellt, dass der Start zwar nur 22min verspätet ist, die Landung aber über eine Stunde später sein soll - statt ca 20:10 Uhr plötzlich 21:27. Das fanden wir schon komisch und wir haben uns gefragt wie das zu Stande kommen kann, haben aber nicht beim Personal nachgefragt.\n\nSoweit, so normal, lief eigentlich alles wie immer am Flughafen und wir saßen am Gate, bis das Boarding losging. Dieses wurde dann auch relativ schnell und problemfrei von der Airline durchgeführt und wir saßen so gegen 19:00 im Flugzeug. Nach einigen Minuten sitzen und der Meldung der Stewardessen, dass das Boarding vollständig sei, kam dann auf einmal eine Durchsage des Piloten, dass der Flug annulliert sei. Das kann ich natürlich nicht mehr wortgenau wiedergeben, aber die Begründung für die Annullierung war, dass wir es (bei 1:20 Flugzeit) nicht mehr geschafft hätten vor der Ruhezeit (23:00 Uhr laut Website Düsseldorf Flughafen) in Düsseldorf zu landen, und sich die Airline deswegen dazu entschieden hat den Flug zu streichen. Die Piloten kamen dann raus und haben auf Fragen geantwortet, während wir darauf gewartet haben, dass wir zurück in den Airport dürfen.\n\nBeim Beantworten der Fragen wurde uns Fluggästen versichert, dass EasyJet uns entschädigt, ein Hotel für die Nacht und einen Rückflug morgen früh organisiert, am selben Tag ist EasyJet nicht mehr nach Düsseldorf oder Köln geflogen. Wir mussten aber auf jeden Fall am heutigen Sonntag noch nach Deutschland zurück, da meine Freundin Montag wieder arbeiten musste (ich habe noch die Woche Urlaub). Zu diesem Zeitpunkt gab es aber auch von anderen Airlines keinen Flug mehr der von Mailand nach Düsseldorf flog, und nur einen Flug von Mailand nach Köln, über Eurowings. Für diesen haben wir (und viele andere) dann selbstständig Tickets für 400€ pro Person gebucht, aber erst nachdem uns die EasyJet Dame am Schalter versichert hat, dass EasyJet die Mehrkosten des neuen Tickets mit bis zu 1000€ pro Person übernimmt. \n\nNachdem das am Flughafen noch alles sehr kulant klang, habe ich mir heute Nacht während der Heimreise mit der Bahn dann noch mal den Flugstatus des EasyJet Fluges, sowie dessen Updates angeschaut. Dort schreibt EasyJet zu der Verspätung um 22min, sowie zu der Annullierung, dass es sich um Entscheidungen der Air Traffic Control handelt, die außerhalb ihrer Kontrolle sind. Das würde EasyJet natürlich super in den Kram passen, weil sie dann nicht zu Entschädigungen verpflichtet sind. Kann EasyJet sich das wirklich so einfach machen? Nochmal zur Erinnerung: Unser Flug sollte um 18:50 abheben, hatte dann 22min Verspätung auf 19:22 Uhr, und hätte es bei 1:20 Flugzeit nicht mehr geschafft vor 23 Uhr zu landen? Wir saßen ja auch alle schon im Flieger. Das erscheint mir irgendwie ziemlich fragwürdig, und ich möchte auf jeden Fall versuchen meine bzw unsere Ansprüche geltend zu machen. \n\nDeswegen jetzt zu meiner Frage: ich wollte im ersten Schritt eine Mail an EasyJet schreiben, wo ich ähnlich wie hier den Ablauf schildere, um dann Entschädigung, Erstattung des eigentlichen Tickets, sowie Übernahme des Aufpreises für das neue Ticket zu fordern. Das alles mit einer 14 Tage Frist. Ist das das beste Vorgehen, oder sollte ich sofort einen Anwalt einschalten? Ich bin Rechtsschutzversichert, meine Freundin aber nicht. Übernimmt meine Rechtsschutz das für uns beide? \n\nDanke schonmal an jeden der sich alles durchgelesen hat und mir eventuell bei meinen Fragen helfen kann.\n\n",

Arrived from the UK on a Swiss operated EasyJet flight, and funnelled through to passport control. I didn’t think anything of it at the time, but there was most definitely no indication or choice as to which country’s immigration desk I could go to, it was one single area for all arriving flights. \n\nAs such, I got a French stamp on entry. It was then only after the passport control and baggage reclaim that I had the choice of the French or Swiss exit through the final ‘customs’ control. \n\nI spent the weekend in Switzerland so I used the Swiss exit door. I then used the Swiss entrance and sector upon my departure for check-in and security. On my way to the gate I encountered the exit passport control, where I received a Swiss stamp. \n\nQuite cool to get both - political opinions aside, I do sort of enjoy collecting stamps in my UK passport now! But still confused as to why I got a French one on entry? As I said, there most definitely was no alternative passport area to go to upon arrival, it was one single area for all. Didn’t even speak to the border agent either, she simply took my passport, scanned, stamped and threw right back at me - so no opportunity to say where I was travelling to. \n\nAny insight into the workings of this airport would be interesting to hear!

The light lyocell trousers + leggings combo really helps with this too.\n* Even though it was very hot, the overshirts worked well to keep the sun off and were a welcome layer in the late evenings. During the hot day it was easy to carry them around by hanging them over my shoulder bag\n* The Muji shoulder bag is fairly new to me, but is a perfect size for carrying small essentials and my fairly bulky sketching kit. I have a large pad added to the strap, and didn't have any shoulder discomfort during the trip\n* Thank god I decided to pack the sandals, it was very last minute and almost didn't, as it's a city. But my god. The HEAT.\n* As the heat continued over the week I lamented over only bringing one pair of shorts, but the surf/swim shorts ended up doubling as regular shorts\n* Technically this 33L backpack exceeds the easyjet size restrictions by height, but if you don't overpack you can squish it down (also they didn't check the size anyway)\n* Still had some room for small souvenirs on the way back, though had to borrow a tiny bit of my friend's suitcase space for large prints that had to be laid flat\n* My white cap with the leaves on top has been an absolute winner for festivals, makes it really easy for friends to spot me in a crowd\n\n**Things I didn't need:**\n\n* Did not use the warm layers; the leggings and the jacket/hoodie. It was pretty much 30c the entire trip, but I get cold really easy so I don't necessarily regret bringing them and will continue to pack them\n* Only used like 2 pairs of socks, on the travel days; ended up only wearing the sandals for the rest of the week\n* Didn't need the umbrella, but it being a mountainous region it can get very stormy, so no regrets (also, as a british person, rain is INEVITABLE)\n\n**Notes for next time:**\n\n* Blister plasters! My sandals unexpectedly rubbed my feet :( I tried my regular plasters but the humidity took them off fairly quickly. Luckily I was able to borrow my friends huge blister plasters which protected my feet from getting worse for the entirety of the trip. The footbeds of the sandals are very comfy though and didn't have foot pain despite 15k+ steps a day\n* more business cards for the next festival lmao\n* maybe swap a pair of trousers for shorts, although this was a hotter week than normal\n\n  \nThanks for reading! I was very pleased I managed to onebag it to the Annecy festival as it usually involves extra art bits and free swag. This backpack is quite old and I'm not a huge fan of it anymore due to a naff organiser pocket and useless cooler pocket, but the cubes and the shoulder bag made everything very easy and modular. \n\n",

    "text": "Please can any pilots help with the queries in this post? First time posting in this sub. \n\nI’m going to Indonesia in 1 month. I feel fine about the long-haul flights to get there and back, but I have to take 2 domestic flights within Indonesia (across different islands) and I’m feeling pretty anxious about it. \n\nFirst domestic flight is 4hrs direct, and the second domestic flight involves 2 separate flights with a layover. Thinking about having to go through another take-off and landing for the separate flights is not a fun thought as I REALLY dislike the sensations that come with take-off and landing. I had a 1hr 30min flight from Kazakhstan (Almaty) to Uzbekistan (Tashkent) last week and the plane felt like it was constantly swaying and dropping from take-off to landing. I was sweating a lot. Logically, I know planes don’t crash due to turbulence but the sensations tell my brain otherwise. \n\nI’m from the UK and have flown a mix of short-haul and long-haul with airlines like British Airways, EasyJet and Ryanair, so I’m familiar with them. \n\nIn Indonesia I’m going to be flying with Batik Air Malaysia and Super Air Jet for the domestic flights. I hadn’t heard of these airlines before so I looked them up for information. I could only see negative things about the airlines but they were mainly referring to delays, cancellations, and expensive baggage allowance. They obviously run many flights per day and don’t appear to have any problems regarding safety. \n\nI believe this is mainly a US-based sub, so I couldn’t find much on here regarding non-Western airline safety regulations, or regarding domestic flights in Indonesia. I saw some comments a while ago from pilots saying they would not fly domestically within Nepal so I’m seeking knowledge and safety reassurance ahead of Indonesia.\n\nCould a pilot here explain whether non-Western airlines adhere to aircraft safety rules and regulations to the same standard as Western airlines? Is there a global aviation safety organisation (or something like this) that every airline across the globe must adhere to? Do pilots across the globe go through the exact same training?\n\nThanks a lot in advance! ",

      "Not flying specific, but when I breastfed my two I would tuck my foot underneath the opposite leg and rest my elbow (with baby laying in the crook of my elbow) on my thigh/knee that was bent. Bent knee would be at the same side I was currently feeding from. I found that offered a bit more support when not having space to use a pillow and I eventually found it a lot easier feeding that way compared to using a pillow. Could he nap on your chest, that way you aren’t straining your shoulder. Bring plenty of muslin cloths for catching sicky burps or if your son is anything like my two, they had a tendency to unlatch at the peak of my letdown as it was too fast, having a muslin close by to shove on my boob caught all the milk and stopped me flashing anyone around me!",
      "If your pillow is the size of their allowed luggage, I don't see why you couldn't take it! I only flew once with BA when still breastfeeding, I asked the crew member for a pillow and they gave me a tiny one that was just fine so I could rest my arm comfortably.",
      "When I flew with my LO it was with BA but I was able to take my nappy bag, a small handbag and my breastfeeding pillow in its carry case - it's a bbhugme, so it's about the dimensions of a yoga mat but you can bend it so it would squash into any luggage rack. I was also able to squeeze some extra bits into the case.\n\nIn the end I didn't bother to use the feeding pillow because it was only a quick flight. I just made liberal use of the elbow rest to take baby's weight when she was feeding and sleeping. \n\nI got her ear defenders to protect her ears from all the noise, but her head was still a little too small for them so not sure how much good they actually did! Trickiest thing was using the miniature changing table in the toilet - I was lucky to have a very kind flight attendant who opened it all up for me before I went in.",

We have been collecting Avios for a while (we had some Qatar flights last year, Amex, Avios purchases).\n\nI really want to take my partner to Prague and use the Avios to reduce the price, if I search EasyJet or Ryanair flights in November, flights now go for about 250£ for both of us without anything extra, I have about 38k of Avios and could get us indirect flights using them for 178£ with all hand bags and even check in bags included. More over if I decided to somehow get to London I could get us a pretty decent deal for business class too and I think my boyfriend would really enjoy the lounge and the experience itself (I know it is just booked out middle seat but still). But it is really inconvenient and fairly costly to get train tickets to London to make it on time for flights. \n\nMy partner needs to book his holidays way ahead at work so I would really like to book this ASAP, I don’t particularly want to fly Ryanair as their cabin bags are too much drama and money than it is worth, I would happily fly EasyJet but do I have any chance of getting a mid year sale this early on? \n\nI would like to clarify I would rather saved the Avios for long haul flights but than again, they are likely not going to have the same value and will deduct much less (as far as I understand how they work).\n\nWhat would you advise?

      "Generally, long haul business class/club world seats are the best use of Avios.  Granted that for two of you, long haul you’ll need to accumulate a lot more Avios, but this can be done using combinations of Barclaycard Avios card, and also BA AMEX (and AMEX Gold) cards. If you are both onboard with applying for cards to maximise welcome bonuses, and also referring each other to gain maximum points, plus achieving the BA AMEX companion voucher it might not be as onerous as you think.   You could always ask chat GPT to formulate a strategy to help you reach whatever goal you decide on, but I always find there is great availability to NYC if you book far ahead in advance. \n\nAlso, flights from MAN, connecting via LHR are considered feeder flights and I’m pretty certain that BA won’t charge you any extra cash or Avios for adding these to your long haul booking - short haul flights are treated differently. \n\nPersonally, for the difference in fares from £178 to £250 I would keep the 38k avios. Even if you have to pay additional for baggage. Especially when you consider the extra you would pay for both of you to train down to London, plus the time involved traipsing across town to LHR…\n\nWhen you do finally find yourself sitting in the ClubSuite sipping champagne, you’ll be very, very pleased with yourself! \n\nEnjoy your holidays no matter what you decide!",
      "The general rule you should apply is £0.01p per avios point, so 38k = £380. If the flight is cheaper than that you are best to pass and look to use them another time",
      "Hi, thank you a lot for your response and advice.\n\nThis makes sense, I will be getting be getting Amex Gold for the lounge companion vouchers so I will likely use it to maximise on the points.",

    "title": "AI Flight 171: A pilot’s perspective",
    "text": "I just want to highlight a few pointers based on some insights and comments in this subreddit and give a pilot’s perspective on it. As for my background, I have been an airline pilot for 10 years with 6000 hours of flight time. I am current on Airbus A320 and is going to transition to Airbus A350 in a month or so. Before A320, I used to pilot Dash 8s Q200 and 300 models.\n\nSo let’s start.\n\n**1. Is it possible to have a dual engine failure?**\n\nIt is not impossible. However, with the reliability of modern engines two engines failing at the same time is highly improbable. So, a complete power loss is unlikely unless an external factor such as birds come into play. If there was indeed a bird strike the resulting compressor stall should have caused bangs and/or flames to eject out of the engines. We don’t see flames or hear such bangs in the available videos.\n\n**2. Is it possible to shut down the live engine after a possible single engine failure?**\n\nThis is possible. There was an accident in Taiwan which involved an ATR aircraft where pilots mistakenly shut down the live engine. If the process of engine securing is hastened without proper cross checks this is a high possibility. This event is again not so likely because pilots usually start the engine securing process after reaching 400ft AGL with the aircraft properly trimmed and in a good flying state. Given that the aircraft crashed at around 600ft, such an event is again not so likely but it is a possibility.\n\n**3. Why the landing gear was down?**\n\nThis I believe was due to a some form of distraction. The aircraft did reach a positive climb right at rotation but the gear remained down. We see this a lot in the simulator. In a stressful go around a lot of extremely good pilots even forget to retract the gear. And also, in cockpit we pilots use triggers. For the gear of the pilot monitoring does not called positive climb/rate the pilot flying most of the times would not call gear up as he or she will be focused on flying.\n\nGiven that there was a Mayday, some event surely caught the attention of the pilots that they kept the gear down. Even in an engine failure event before anything else you get the gear up to reduce drag.\n\n**4. Can a pilot retract flaps instead of landing gear when called for gear up?**\n\nYes. This has happened in the past. However, non of those incidents lead to a crash. Can it lead to one? The answer is yes because as soon as flaps are retracted the margin to stall is reduced as the wings lose lift. We know it was a heavy takeoff and the temperatures were high as well. Not great conditions to lose lift, especially close to the ground.\n\nhttps://www.aeroinside.com/7143/easyjet-a319-at-bristol-on-feb-16th-2016-flaps-instead-gear-retracted\n\n**5. Was it a problem that the aircraft had a long takeoff roll?**\n\nNot necessarily. We base of the required engine thrust based on the runway distance available, the prevailing temperature, pressure, weight etc. If you have a long runway you can use it to reduce engine thrust to go for a slow acceleration to attain the required rotation speed. \n\nThe conditions at the airport (hot day) and also given that it was a heavy take off a long takeoff roll is not unusual.\n\n**6. Was the takeoff performance calculated wrong?**\n\nThis is again a possibility. If incorrect weight or weather conditions is entered into the performance software it will give out wrong information. And the FMS will accept the data entered into it as it does not really know what is happening because it works on entered information. That is why pilots are supposed to calculate performance data independently without discussing with each other. Once independently calculated a crosscheck must be done to ensure data uniformity. This way errors are reduced.\n\nA wrong performance calculation can make the engines produce less thrust, lead to improper take off speeds and an inadequate flap setting. This can result in a crash as the airplane may not produce enough lift and or power to properly take off. \n\nThese are the main points I want to highlight. If you guys have any questions please do ask and this is just my opinion based on my experience and it can change once the investigation comes up with new information.\n\nFinally, your opinions and suggestions are always welcome.",

      "I think the most important thing here, as pilots, is to educate people about the flap issue. For the average Joe, it’s tempting to fall for oversimplified explanations, especially those that put 100% of the blame on people who aren’t around to defend themselves\n\nThat’s not to say they bear no future responsibility, but we, more than anyone, understand that an accident of this scale never comes down to just one major factor",
      ">A wrong performance calculation can make the engines produce less thrust, improper take off speeds and an inadequate flap setting.

    "title": "Affordable Flights to Europe from NYC: Your Ultimate Travel Guide",
    "text": "Okay, settle in, because we're about to embark on a virtual transatlantic journey. Getting ready to hop across the pond from the bustling metropolis of New York City to the varied wonders of Europe? It's an exciting prospect, isn't it? The sheer thought of wandering ancient cobbled streets, sipping espresso in a charming cafe, or standing in awe before iconic landmarks is enough to make anyone a little giddy. But before you can start picturing yourself doing all that, there’s one crucial hurdle: finding those just-right flights. Navigating the world of airfare can feel like a bit of a wild goose chase sometimes, a labyrinth of ever-changing prices and confounding options. So, let's unravel this mystery together and get you pointed in the right direction for securing those coveted seats across the Atlantic.\n\n### Ready to Roll: Where to Jet Off When Considering Flights to Europe from NYC?\n\nSo, you've decided Europe is calling your name. Fantastic choice! But \"Europe\" is a big place, stretching from the sun-drenched beaches of the Mediterranean to the dramatic fjords of Scandinavia, and everywhere in between. The beauty of flying from a major hub like NYC is the sheer number of possibilities. Your dream European destination is likely just a flight away, whether you're yearning for the romantic canals of Venice, the artistic buzz of Paris, the historical depth of Rome, the vibrant nightlife of Berlin, or the friendly pubs of Dublin. Think about what kind of experience you're after. Are you a history buff itching to explore ancient ruins? A food lover eager to sample regional delicacies? An adventurer seeking outdoor thrills? Pinpointing your ideal European vibe will help narrow down your search for the perfect flight path.\n\n### Picking Your Landing Spot: Popular European Gateways from NYC\n\nWhen you're looking at flights to Europe from NYC, certain cities act as major hubs, sort of like transfer points, offering frequent connections and often more competitive prices. These are the big hitters, the places where many transatlantic routes terminate or begin. Knowing these key airports can be super helpful in your planning, even if your final destination is somewhere a little smaller. Think of them as your launching pads into the European whirlwind.\n\n- **London (LHR, LGW, STN):** A perennial favorite, and for good reason. London is easily accessible from NYC and serves as a massive gateway to the rest of Europe. You've got multiple airports here, each with its own advantages and disadvantages, so it's worth checking which one your flight lands at.\n- **Paris (CDG, ORY):** Another iconic European capital and a significant entry point. Paris is well-connected by high-speed rail to many other European cities, making it a great base for a multi-city trip.\n- **Dublin (DUB):** A fantastic option if you're heading to Ireland or looking for potentially cheaper flights to then connect elsewhere in Europe, especially with budget carriers.\n- **Amsterdam (AMS):** Schiphol Airport is a major European hub, known for its efficiency and excellent connections. Amsterdam itself is a charming city to explore too.\n- **Frankfurt (FRA):** A massive airport and a major hub for Lufthansa. Frankfurt offers a wealth of connections across Germany and beyond.\n- **Rome (FCO):** The Eternal City is always popular, and its airport serves as a key entry point into Italy.\n\nThese are just a handful of the most popular options, of course. Depending on your final destination, you might find direct flights or good connections to other cities like Madrid, Lisbon, Reykjavik, or Zurich.\n\n### Timing is Everything: When's the Prime Time to Snag Those Flights to Europe from NYC?\n\nOkay, let’s be real. Nobody wants to pay an arm and a leg for a flight. The good news is that with a little strategy, you can often find some decent deals on flights to Europe from NYC. When you fly makes a world of difference to the price tag. Thinking about seasonality is key here.\n\n- **Low Season (Shoulder Seasons - Spring and Fall):** This is generally considered the sweet spot. Think March to May and September to November. The weather is often pleasant, crowds are thinner than in the summer, and critically, flight prices tend to be more reasonable. It can be a fantastic time to visit popular cities without feeling overwhelmed. You might even stumble upon some unexpected sunshine or vibrant autumn foliage.\n- **Peak Season (Summer):** July and August are prime time for European travel, and the flight prices reflect that. Everyone wants to be there when the weather's warm and the school holidays are in full swing. If your heart is set on a summer trip, book far in advance and be prepared to pay a premium.\n- **Off-Season (Winter):** December to February (excluding the Christmas/New Year period) is typically the cheapest time to fly. Sure, the weather can be chilly, and daylight hours are shorter, but many European cities have a magical charm in the winter, with festive markets and fewer tourists. Plus, you can often snag some incredible deals on flights and accommodation.\n\nBeyond the general seasons, specific factors can influence prices. Flying mid-week is usually cheaper than flying on a Friday or Saturday. Red-eye flights, while sometimes a pain, can also be less expensive. And keep an eye on major European holidays or events, as they can significantly drive up prices.\n\n### Duration Matters: Delving into Flight Lengths and Layover Strategies\n\nAlright, let's talk turkey about the journey itself. When you're pondering flights to Europe from NYC, the length of the flight is a big consideration, right? Non-stop flights are the holy grail for many – they're typically the shortest in duration and save you the hassle and potential stress of connecting. Direct flights from NYC to major European cities can range anywhere from about 6 to 8 hours, depending on the destination (London is closer than, say, Rome or Athens).\n\nHowever, non-stop flights aren’t always the cheapest or the most convenient for your final destination. Connecting flights, while adding to your travel time, can sometimes offer significant savings. The trick is to manage those layovers. A short layover (say, under 2 hours) can feel rushed and nerve-wracking if your first flight is delayed. A super long layover (think more than 8-10 hours) can be exhausting, but it can also be an opportunity to get a quick taste of your layover city, provided you have the necessary visas and time to clear customs.\n\nHere's a quick rundown of layover considerations:\n\n- **Minimum Connection Time (MCT):** Airlines and airports have minimum recommended times for connecting flights. Booking a connection below the MCT significantly increases your risk of missing your second flight.\n- **Airport Size and Layout:** Connecting in a massive, spread-out airport like London Heathrow or Frankfurt can take longer than in a smaller, more efficient one. Research the airport layout beforehand if you have a tight connection.\n- **Airline Alliances:** If you book a connection with partner airlines within the same alliance (like Star Alliance, Oneworld, or SkyTeam), transferring luggage and handling delays can sometimes be smoother.\n\nUltimately, the ideal flight duration and layover strategy depend on your budget, tolerance for travel time, and personal preferences. Sometimes paying a little extra for a more convenient flight is well worth the peace of mind.\n\n### Getting Savvy: Unearthing the Best Tools and Tactics for Finding Affordable Flights\n\nOkay, this is where the rubber meets the road. How do you actually *find* those good deals on flights to Europe from NYC? It's not just about luck; there's a whole arsenal of tools and tactics you can employ to give yourself an edge. Gone are the days of simply calling a travel agent; the internet has put the power (and the complexity) in your hands.\n\nLet’s talk about the big players in the flight-searching game:\n\n- **Google Flights:** My personal favorite! It's incredibly user-friendly, allows you to track prices for specific routes, and offers flexible date searches so you can see which days are cheapest to fly. You can also explore destinations on a map and see flight prices to various European cities from NYC.\n- **Skyscanner:** Another fantastic option that aggregates results from countless airlines and online travel agencies. Skyscanner is great for its \"Everywhere\" search feature, perfect if you're open to different destinations.\n- **Momondo:** Known for finding unique routing options and occasionally digging up lower prices than other platforms.\n- **Kayak:** A veteran in the flight search game, offering price forecasting and other useful tools.\n- **Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) like Expedia, Priceline, etc.:** While these can sometimes offer competitive prices by bundling flights and hotels, it's often best to book directly with the airline if possible. This makes rebooking, canceling, or dealing with issues much easier. Just saying!\n\nBeyond these search engines, here are some savvy tactics to keep in mind:\n\n- **Be Flexible with Your Dates:** Even shifting your departure or return date by a day or two can make a notable difference in price.\n- **Consider Nearby Airports:** Sometimes flying into a smaller airport near your final destination and then taking a train or bus can be cheaper than flying directly into the main city airport.\n- **Fly Mid-Week:** Tuesdays and Wednesdays are often the cheapest days to fly.\n- **Set Price Alerts:** Use tools like Google Flights to get notifications when the price for your desired route changes.\n- **Look at One-Way Fares:** Sometimes booking two one-way flights with different airlines can be cheaper than a round trip.\n- **Clear Your Cache and Cookies:** While debated, some believe airlines and booking sites may increase prices if they see you repeatedly searching for the same flight. Worth a shot if you ask me!\n- **Consider Budget Airlines:** Once you've crossed the Atlantic, budget airlines like Ryanair, EasyJet, and Vueling can offer incredibly cheap fares for hopping between European cities. Just be aware of their strict baggage rules and other fees.\n- **Check Airline Websites Directly:** After finding a good price on a search engine, always check the airline's website. Sometimes the price is the same, or even slightly lower, and booking direct offers more protection.\n\nFinding cheap flights takes a little patience and perseverance, but with these tools and strategies, you'll be well on your way to snagging a great deal.\n\n### The Baggage Ballet: Understanding Airline Allowances and Fees\n\nThinking about flights to Europe from NYC also means thinking about what you're going to pack and, more importantly, what the airline will let you bring and for how much! Baggage rules can vary widely between airlines, and getting it wrong can lead to unexpected and hefty fees at the airport. Nobody wants that kind of surprise!\n\nHere's the general gist of it:\n\n- **Checked Baggage:** Most major airlines flying transatlantic will include one or two checked bags in their standard economy fares. However, this isn't always the case, especially with basic economy fares or some European carriers. Pay close attention to the weight and size restrictions. Going over can be expensive.\n- **Carry-On Baggage:** You're typically allowed one carry-on bag and one personal item (like a backpack, purse, or laptop bag). Again, size and weight limits apply, and airlines are getting stricter about enforcing these. Make sure your carry-on fits in the overhead bin or under the seat in front of you.\n- **Budget Airlines:** This is where things get tricky. Budget airlines are notorious for charging extra for checked baggage and often have stricter limits on carry-on size and weight. Read their baggage policies *very* carefully before booking.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Weigh your bags at home to avoid surprises at the airport. If you're close to the limit, consider wearing some of your bulkier items (like that thick sweater or hiking boots) or transferring some items to your carry-on.\n\nUnderstanding the baggage rules upfront is super important for budgeting your trip and avoiding last-minute stress at the check-in counter.\n\n### Beyond the Ticket Price: Considering the \"Hidden\" Costs of Transatlantic Flights\n\nWhile the sticker price of your flight is obviously a huge factor, there are other costs associated with flying across the Atlantic that you should factor into your budget. Thinking about these beforehand will give you a more realistic picture of the total cost of your journey.\n\n- **Baggage Fees:** As we just discussed, exceeding baggage allowances can add a significant amount to your bill.\n- **Seat Selection Fees:** Many airlines now charge extra for choosing your seat, especially for aisle or window seats, or those with extra legroom. If you don't pay, you'll be assigned a seat at check-in.\n- **In-Flight Amenities:** While transatlantic flights generally include meals and entertainment, some airlines may charge for things like Wi-Fi or premium snacks and drinks.\n- **Airport Transfers:** Getting to and from the airport adds to your costs. Consider the price of taxis, ride-sharing services, public transport, or airport parking.\n- **Travel Insurance:** While not a mandatory cost of the flight itself, travel insurance is highly recommended, especially for international trips. It can protect you financially in case of flight cancellations, delays, lost luggage, or medical emergencies.\n- **Currency Exchange Fees:** When booking international flights, you might encounter currency exchange fees depending on your credit card or payment method.\n\nBy considering these \"hidden\" costs, you can build a more accurate budget for your trip and avoid any nasty surprises.\n\n\"Save up to 90% on flights with these amazing deals: https://educdunet.com/\"\n\n### Making the Most of Your Flight: Tips for a Smoother Journey\n\nOkay, you've booked your flights to Europe from NYC, you've got your baggage sorted, and you're ready to go! Now, how do you make the actual flight experience as comfortable and enjoyable as possible? Transatlantic flights are long haul, let's not kid ourselves, so a little preparation and some savvy tips can make a world of difference.\n\nHere are a few things to keep in mind:\n\n- **Choose Your Seat Wisely:** If you can afford it, selecting a seat beforehand can be worth the cost, especially if you have a preference for window (for the views and leaning space) or aisle (for easier access to the lavatory and stretching). Emergency exit rows offer extra legroom but often come with restrictions and responsibilities.\n- **Pack Smart for Your Carry-On:** Bring everything you’ll need during the flight in your carry-on. This includes medications, a change of clothes, toiletries, entertainment (books, downloaded movies/shows), a neck pillow, eye mask, and earplugs.\n- **Stay Hydrated:** The cabin air is dry, so drink plenty of water throughout the flight. Avoid excessive alcohol and caffeine, which can contribute to dehydration and jet lag.\n- **Move Around:** Get up and walk around the cabin periodically to prevent stiffness and improve circulation. Simple stretches in your seat can also help.\n- **Combat Jet Lag:** Try to adjust your sleep schedule to your destination’s time zone a few days before you leave. Once you arrive, expose yourself to daylight and try to stay awake until local bedtime.\n- **Dress Comfortably:** Wear loose-fitting, comfortable clothing layers on the plane. The cabin temperature can fluctuate.\n- **Bring Entertainment:** While in-flight entertainment systems are common, having your own books, podcasts, or downloaded media can be a lifesaver, especially if the system isn't working or the selection isn't to your liking.\n- **Noise-Canceling Headphones:** These are a game-changer for blocking out engine noise and crying babies.\n- **Bring Snacks:** While airlines provide meals, it’s always a good idea to have some snacks on hand, especially if you have dietary restrictions or get hungry between meals.\n\nFollowing these tips can help turn a potentially long and uncomfortable flight into a more manageable and even pleasant experience.\n\n### What About Non-Direct Options? Exploring Alternative Routes\n\nWhile flying directly from NYC to a major European hub is often the most straightforward option when considering flights to Europe from NYC, sometimes the cheapest or most convenient route involves a stop or two. Don't dismiss these options out of hand!\n\nHere are some scenarios where considering non-direct flights might be worthwhile:\n\n- **Lower Prices:** Often, flights with layovers are significantly cheaper than non-stop options.\n- **Reaching Smaller Cities:** If your final destination isn't a major hub, you'll likely need a connecting flight anyway. Looking for connections through different European gateways can sometimes provide better routing or pricing.\n- **Airline Preferences:** You might prefer to fly a particular airline that only offers connecting flights on your desired route.\n- **Breaking Up a Long Journey:** Some travelers prefer to break up a very long flight (like flying to Eastern Europe or beyond) with a stopover.\n\nWhen considering connecting flights, pay attention to:\n\n- **Layover Duration:** As mentioned earlier, factor in the minimum connection time and your tolerance for waiting at airports.\n- **Airport Location:** If your layover is in a city you'd like to explore, a longer layover could be a bonus. Just make sure you have enough time to leave the airport, see something, and get back for your connecting flight.\n- **Airline Reputation:** Research the airlines involved, especially if you're connecting with a carrier you haven't flown before.\n\nSometimes, a little extra travel time can unlock more affordable or convenient ways to get to your desired European destination.\n\n### The Nitty-Gritty: Essential Documents and Pre-Flight Prep\n\nOkay, the excitement is building! You know where you're going, you've booked your flights to Europe from NYC, and you're thinking about what to pack. But before you can jet off, there are a few crucial bits of paperwork and preparation you absolutely cannot overlook. Getting this stuff sorted well in advance will save you a heap of stress and potential headaches closer to your departure date.\n\nHere's your essential pre-flight checklist:\n\n1. **Passport Validity:** This is non-negotiable. Your passport must be valid for at least **three months beyond your intended date of departure from the Schengen Area** (most Western European countries are part of this) and issued within the last 10 years. Some countries might have slightly different requirements, so always double-check the specific regulations for your destination. If your passport is expiring soon, apply for a renewal well in advance – passport processing times can be unpredictable.\n2. **Visas:** Do you need a visa for the country or countries you plan to visit? US citizens can typically stay in the Schengen Area for up to 90 days within any 180-day period without a visa for tourism or business purposes. However, this doesn't apply to all European countries (the UK and Ireland, for example, have their own entry requirements), and the rules are set to change with the implementation of the ETIAS system (European Travel Information and Authorisation System) likely in 2025. Keep an eye on official government websites for the latest information.\n3. **Travel Insurance:** We've already touched on this, but it's worth reiterating. Travel insurance is crucial for covering unexpected events that could disrupt your trip or lead to financial losses.\n4. **Flight Confirmation and Details:** Have a digital or printed copy of your flight confirmation, including your booking reference number. Note down your flight number, departure and arrival times, and terminal information.\n5. **Accommodation Details:** Have the addresses and contact information for your accommodation handy.\n6. **Emergency Contacts:** Leave copies of your itinerary and emergency contact information with a trusted friend or family member back home.\n7. **Notify Your Bank:** Inform your bank and credit card companies of your travel dates and destinations to avoid having your cards flagged for suspicious activity and potentially frozen.\n8. **Download Necessary Apps:** Download airline apps, airport maps, public transport apps for your destination, and translation apps.\n9. **Check for Travel Advisories:** Stay informed about any travel advisories or safety concerns for your destination.\n10. **Pack Smart (Again!):** Double-check the baggage rules for your specific airline and make sure your carry-on contains all your essentials.\n\nGetting ahead of these important details will allow you to approach your travel day with much more confidence and less anxiety.\n\n### The Day Of: Navigating the Airport and Your Flight\n\nThe big day has arrived! You're heading to the airport to catch your flights to Europe from NYC. While it might feel a little chaotic, especially at a busy hub like JFK or EWR, being prepared can make the process much smoother.\n\nHere's what to expect and how to make the most of your airport experience:\n\n- **Arrive Early:** For international flights, it's generally recommended to arrive at the airport at least 3 hours before your scheduled departure time. This gives you ample time for check-in, security, and finding your gate, even if there are unexpected delays.\n- **Check-In Online:** Most airlines allow you to check in online 24 hours before your flight. This can save you time at the airport, especially if you only have carry-on baggage.\n- **Security Procedures:** Be prepared for airport security. Have your ID and boarding pass ready. Know the rules for liquids and gels in your carry-on (they must be in containers of 3.4 ounces or less and fit in one quart-sized clear plastic bag). Be prepared to remove electronics like laptops from your bag and take off your shoes and belt if requested.\n- **Find Your Gate:** Once through security, locate your departure gate. Airport screens will display the gate number, and it's a good idea to check these periodically for any changes.\n- **Boarding Process:** Pay attention to the boarding announcements. Airlines typically board by zones or groups. Have your boarding pass and passport ready.\n- **Settle In:** Once on the plane, stow your carry-on in the overhead bin or under the seat in front of you. Make yourself comfortable – grab your blanket and pillow if provided, and get settled in.\n- **Listen to the Safety Briefing:** Even if you're a frequent flyer, it's important to pay attention to the pre-flight safety briefing.\n- **In-Flight Service:** Be polite and respectful to the flight attendants. They're there to ensure your safety and comfort.\n\nThe airport experience can be a bit of a whirlwind, but by being prepared and following these tips, you can navigate it with relative ease and focus on the exciting journey ahead.\n\n\"Save up to 90% on flights with these amazing deals: https://educdunet.com/\"\n\nConclusion: Ready to Soar Across the Atlantic!\n\nPhew!

    "text": "Oh, the eternal wanderlust! That itch under your skin that whispers of cobblestone streets, ancient castles, and cafés where coffee is a ritual, not just a caffeine fix. And if you're starting from the concrete jungle, from the city that *literally* never sleeps, well, the leap across the pond feels particularly epic, doesn't it? We're talking about the ultimate adventure, the big one: getting from **nyc to europe**. It’s more than just booking a flight; it’s a state of mind, a logistical puzzle laced with excitement, and ultimately, an unforgettable journey. So, buckle up, buttercup, because we're about to dive headfirst into planning your European escapade from the Big Apple. This isn't your grandma's travel guide; we're going to get real, get granular, and get you across the Atlantic without feeling like you've been put through the wringer. Ready? Let's get started!\n\n### The Genesis of a European Dream: Why Leave the Greatest City on Earth?\n\nSeriously, why *would* you abandon the bright lights and siren song of New York City for a while? It’s a fair question, and one posed by perplexed friends and family alike. But for those of us bitten by the travel bug, the allure of Europe is undeniable. It's a continent steeped in history, bursting with diverse cultures, and offering a kaleidoscope of experiences. From the sun-drenched beaches of the Mediterranean to the snow-capped peaks of the Alps, there's something for everyone. Maybe you're craving a romantic getaway to Paris, a historical deep dive into Rome, an artistic pilgrimage to Florence, or perhaps you just want to wander aimlessly through the charming villages of the English countryside. Whatever your motivation, the call of Europe is a powerful one, a siren song that’s hard to resist, especially when you’re staring at the same skyscrapers day in and day out.\n\n#### Unpacking the \"Why\": The Irresistible Pull Across the Pond\n\nSo, let’s get down to the nitty-gritty. Why the big jump from NYC? What's so darn appealing about Europe that it makes you want to brave jet lag and currency exchange rates? For starters, there's the history, palpable in every ancient ruin, every medieval castle, and every grand cathedral. You can literally walk in the footsteps of emperors, artists, and revolutionaries. It’s a living, breathing history lesson, far more engaging than any textbook. Then there's the culture – the art, the music, the food! Oh, the food! From flaky croissants in Paris to authentic pasta in Italy and hearty stews in Germany, your taste buds are in for a wild ride. Beyond the famous sights, there's the chance to slow down, to savor life at a different pace. New York is all hustle and bustle, a relentless march forward. Europe, in many places, encourages you to linger, to people-watch at a cafe for hours, to get lost in winding streets. It's a reset button, a chance to breathe deeply and experience the world through a different lens. And let's be honest, bragging rights play a small part, don't they? \"Oh, I just got back from hiking in the Swiss Alps,\" sounds pretty darn impressive, even if you only made it halfway up.\n\n### Navigating the Airways: Getting from nyc to europe\n\nThis is where the rubber meets the road, folks – the actual act of getting over there. Flying from **nyc to europe** is undoubtedly the most common way to traverse the Atlantic. It's a long flight, no two ways about it. Think 7-8 hours minimum to Western Europe, and even longer to Eastern European destinations. But with advancements in aircraft technology and increasing competition among airlines, the journey has become more comfortable and, dare I say, even enjoyable (if you're lucky enough to score a seat with decent legroom!). There are direct flights galore from the major New York airports (JFK, LaGuardia - though less common for transatlantic, and Newark Liberty) to a plethora of European hubs like London, Paris, Rome, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, and many more. Non-stop is always the dream, minimizing layovers and getting you to your destination faster. However, sometimes connecting flights can offer significant cost savings, forcing you to weigh convenience against budget. It’s a classic travel dilemma, like choosing between a great slice of pizza and a killer bagel – both delicious, but different experiences!\n\n#### The Nitty-Gritty of Booking Your Flight: A Tactical Approach\n\nBooking your flight from NYC to Europe can feel overwhelming, a bit like trying to find a specific grain of sand on a beach. There are so many airlines, so many routes, and prices that seem to fluctuate with the wind. So, how do you tackle this beast?\n\n- **Start Early:** Seriously, this is perhaps the most important piece of advice. Especially if you're planning to travel during peak season (summer, holidays), booking several months in advance can save you a bundle. Airlines release their tickets far in advance, and waiting until the last minute is a sure-fire way to pay top dollar.\n- **Be Flexible with Your Dates:** If your travel dates are rigid, you're limiting your options. Even shifting your departure or return date by a day or two can dramatically impact the price. Tuesdays and Wednesdays often have the lowest fares, while weekends tend to be the most expensive. Think of it as playing the stock market of airfare – timing is everything!\n- **Consider Different Airports:** Don't just focus on the mega-airports. Sometimes flying into a smaller, secondary airport near your desired destination can be cheaper. For example, instead of flying directly into Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG), consider Orly (ORY). Research ground transportation options from these smaller airports; a little extra travel time on the ground might be worth the savings on your flight.\n- **Utilize Flight Comparison Websites:** Google Flights, Skyscanner, Kayak, Momondo – these are your best friends. They aggregate prices from various airlines and travel agencies, making it easy to compare options. Set price alerts so you're notified when fares drop.\n- **Be Mindful of Hidden Fees:** Read the fine print! Baggage fees, seat selection fees, and even credit card processing fees can add up. Factor these into the total cost when comparing flights. Low-cost carriers (like Ryanair or EasyJet, which you might connect to for intra-European travel) are notorious for nickel-and-diming, so be prepared.\n- **Think About Alliances:** If you're loyal to a particular airline or have frequent flyer miles, check if they're part of a global alliance (Star Alliance, SkyTeam, Oneworld). Flying within an alliance can help you earn and redeem miles and sometimes offer perks like lounge access.\n- **Consider Budget Airlines (with caution):** For intra-European travel after you've crossed the Atlantic, budget airlines can be incredibly cheap. However, they often fly to secondary airports (requiring longer transfers) and have strict baggage restrictions. Don't expect a gourmet meal or lots of legroom! It's a no-frills experience, but it can save you a pretty penny.\n\n\"Save up to 90% on flights with these amazing deals: https://educdunet.com/\"\n\n### Beyond the Ticket: The Logistics of Your European Journey\n\nOkay, you've booked your flight. High fives all around! But getting from NYC to Europe is more than just buying a ticket. There are myriad other things to consider to ensure a smooth and stress-free trip. Think of it like packing for a marathon – the flight is just the start of the race; you need to be prepared for everything that comes after. From passports and visas to currency and connectivity, the devil is in the details, as they say. Getting these ducks in a row beforehand will save you a lot of headaches and allow you to fully immerse yourself in your European adventure.\n\n#### The Pre-Departure Checklist: Ticking All the Boxes\n\nBefore you even think about packing that suitcase (more on that later!), you need to get organized. This is where being a planner pays off in spades.\n\n- **Passport Power:** Is your passport valid? Does it have at least six months of validity beyond your planned departure date from Europe? This is crucial! Some countries are very strict about this. Does it have enough blank pages for stamps? If not, you'll need to renew it, and that can take time. Don't wait until the last minute!\n- **Visa Verifications:** Are you an American citizen traveling to Europe? For stays up to 90 days within a 180-day period in the Schengen Area (most European countries), you typically don't need a visa for tourism or business. However, it's ALWAYS a good idea to check the specific entry requirements for *each* country you plan to visit. The rules can and do change. Better safe than sorry!\n- **Travel Insurance: Your Safety Net:** Don't skip this! Travel insurance is like a superhero cape for your trip. It can cover unexpected medical expenses, trip cancellations or delays, lost luggage, and even emergency evacuations. The cost is usually a small percentage of your overall trip, but the peace of mind it provides is invaluable.\n- **Money Matters: Euros and Beyond:** While the Euro is the common currency in many European countries, others use their own (British Pounds in the UK, Swiss Francs in Switzerland, etc.). Research the currency of each country you're visiting. Inform your bank and credit card companies of your travel plans to avoid having your cards blocked. Consider using a travel credit card with no foreign transaction fees. Having some local currency on hand for small purchases or tips is also a good idea.\n- **Staying Connected: SIM Cards and Wi-Fi:** How will you stay in touch? Will you rely on free Wi-Fi (which can be spotty), purchase a local SIM card (usually a good value), or use an international roaming plan (can be expensive)? Decide on your strategy before you go. Having data is incredibly helpful for navigation and communication.\n- **Getting Around Europe: Trains, Planes, and Automobiles:** Once you're on the continent, how will you travel between cities and countries? Europe has an excellent rail network, which is often a scenic and efficient way to travel. Budget airlines are also an option for longer distances. Renting a car can be great for exploring rural areas, but be prepared for narrow roads, different driving rules (driving on the left in the UK!), and potentially expensive parking.\n- **Learning a Few Phrases:** While many Europeans speak English, especially in tourist areas, knowing a few basic phrases in the local language (hello, please, thank you, excuse me, do you speak English?) goes a long way and is always appreciated. It shows respect for the local culture.\n\n### Packing for Your European Adventure: Less is More, Usually\n\nAh, packing. The bane of many a traveler's existence. Packing for a trip from NYC to Europe, especially if you're planning to visit multiple destinations with varying climates and activities, can feel like a complex Tetris game magnified by a thousand. The key, however, especially if you plan on moving around a lot, is to pack light. \"Less is more\" is the mantra here. Every extra ounce you pack is an ounce you'll have to lug onto trains, up stairs, and through cobblestone streets. Trust me, your back will thank you.\n\n#### The Art of the Savvy European Suitcase: What to Bring and What to Leave Behind\n\nPacking efficiently is a skill, my friends. And for a European trip, it’s a skill worth mastering. Here’s a breakdown of how to build your perfect European wardrobe and essentials:\n\n1. **Layering is Your Friend:** European weather can be unpredictable, even in the same season. Pack layers that you can easily add or remove. Think t-shirts, long-sleeve shirts, sweaters, and a versatile jacket.\n2. **Comfortable Footwear is Non-Negotiable:** You *will* be doing a lot of walking. Leave the stilettos (unless you're *strictly* going out for fancy dinners in taxis) and uncomfortable shoes at home. Prioritize comfy sneakers, walking shoes, or sturdy boots. Your feet will thank you after a day exploring ancient ruins or navigating busy city streets.\n3. **Versatile Clothing:** Pack items that you can mix and match to create multiple outfits. Neutral colors work wonders. Scarves are great for adding a pop of color or covering your shoulders in churches.\n4. **Travel Adapters and Converters:** European electrical outlets are different from those in the US. You'll need a travel adapter to plug in your devices. Check if your electronics are dual-voltage (most modern ones are); if not, you'll also need a converter.\n5. **Medications and First-Aid:** Pack any prescription medications you need, along with a small first-aid kit containing essentials like pain relievers, band-aids, antiseptic wipes, and any over-the-counter medications you might need for common travel woes (like upset stomachs).\n6. **Copies of Important Documents:** Make photocopies or take pictures of your passport, visa (if applicable), and travel insurance information. Store them separately from the originals in case of loss or theft.\n7. **A Good Quality Travel Bag/Backpack:** Whether you prefer a suitcase or a backpack, choose one that is lightweight, durable, and easy to maneuver. If you plan on moving frequently, a backpack might be more practical.\n8. **Reusable Water Bottle:** Stay hydrated and save money by refilling your water bottle. Many European cities have public fountains where you can fill up.\n9. **An Open Mind and a Sense of Adventure:** This is arguably the most important thing to pack! Be open to new experiences, different cultures, and unexpected detours. Embrace the serendipity of travel.\n\n### Arriving in Europe: Stepping Onto a New Continent\n\nThe long flight is over. You've navigated customs and immigration. You've officially made it from NYC to Europe! Now what? Stepping off that plane and onto European soil is an exhilarating feeling, a mixture of exhaustion and pure excitement. The air might smell different, the language around you might be unfamiliar, and suddenly, you're truly *there*. But before you rush off to find the nearest gelato stand or pub, there are a few practicalities to consider upon arrival.\n\n#### Your First Steps on European Ground: From Airport to Accommodation\n\nThe first few hours in a new country can be a little disorienting, even for seasoned travelers. Having a plan for getting from the airport to your accommodation will make a world of difference.\n\n- **Public Transportation: Your Best Bet:** European cities generally have excellent public transportation systems. Trains, buses, and metro lines are often the most affordable and efficient way to get from the airport to the city center. Do a little research beforehand on the best route to your accommodation.\n- **Taxis: Convenient, but Pricier:** Taxis are readily available but will be significantly more expensive than public transport. Make sure you use official taxis and agree on a fare or ensure the meter is running.\n- **Ride-Sharing Apps:** Uber and similar ride-sharing services are available in many European cities, offering a convenient alternative to traditional taxis.\n- **Airport Transfers:** Some hotels offer airport transfer services, which can be convenient but are usually more expensive than public transport.\n- **Validate Your Tickets:** If you use public transportation, make sure you validate your ticket! There are often machines for this, and ticket inspectors can be strict, issuing hefty fines if you don't.\n- **Orientation and Getting Your Bearings:** Once you’ve reached your accommodation, take a moment to get your bearings. Locate nearby landmarks, familiarize yourself with the local area, and figure out the nearest public transit stops. A quick walk around the block can help you feel more settled.\n\n### Embracing the European Experience: More Than Just Sightseeing\n\nYou didn't come all the way from NYC to Europe just to snap photos of famous landmarks, did you? (Okay, maybe a little bit!). But the true magic of Europe lies in immersing yourself in the local culture, in savoring the little moments, and in allowing yourself to slow down and simply *be*. It's about sitting in a piazza and watching the world go by, getting lost in a charming neighborhood, and striking up conversations with locals (even if it’s just with smiles and gestures).\n\n#### Savoring the Journey: How to Truly Experience Europe\n\nThis is where the rich tapestry of Europe unfolds. It’s about more than just ticking items off a list; it's about building memories.\n\n- **Wander Aimlessly:** Don't overschedule yourself. Leave room for spontaneity and just wandering around. Some of the best discoveries are made when you get a little bit lost (in a safe way, of course!).\n- **Eat Like a Local:** Venture beyond the tourist traps and seek out local restaurants and cafes. Ask for recommendations from locals. Try the regional specialties. Food is such an integral part of European culture.\n- **Embrace the Cafe Culture:** Find a cozy cafe, order a coffee or a glass of wine, and simply people-watch. It's a quintessential European experience and a great way to soak in the atmosphere.\n- **Visit Local Markets:** Markets are fantastic places to experience the sights, sounds, and smells of a city. You can find local produce, cheeses, baked goods, crafts, and often delicious street food.\n- **Attend Local Events:** Check for local festivals, concerts, or sporting events happening during your visit. Participating in these can offer a unique glimpse into the local culture.\n- **Learn a Few Words of the Local Language:** We mentioned this before, but it bears repeating. Even a few words show respect and can open doors to more meaningful interactions.\n- **Strike Up Conversations:** Don't be afraid to talk to locals. They can offer invaluable insights and recommendations that you won't find in guidebooks.\n- **Slow Down and Observe:** New York is fast-paced; Europe often encourages a slower rhythm. Allow yourself to adjust to that pace. Sit on a park bench, watch the world go by, and simply observe.\n\n\"Save up to 90% on flights with these amazing deals: https://educdunet.com/\"\n\n### Common Potholes and How to Avoid Them: A Heads-Up for the NYC Traveler\n\nAlright, let's be real for a second. Even the most perfectly planned trip can hit a snag. Travel isn't always seamless, and knowing some of the potential pitfalls beforehand can help you navigate them with grace (or at least minimize the stress). Coming from NYC, you're probably pretty street-smart, but Europe has its own unique quirks and challenges. A little foresight goes a long way in preventing those frustrating moments that can sometimes put a damper on your adventure.\n\n#### Anticipating Obstacles: Preparing for the Unexpected\n\nBeing forewarned is being forearmed, as the saying goes. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you explore Europe:\n\n- **Pickpocketing and Petty Theft:** Unfortunately, pickpocketing can be an issue in crowded tourist areas in some European cities. Be aware of your surroundings, keep your valuables secure, and consider wearing a money belt or a cross-body bag that's difficult to access.\n- **Scams:** Be wary of overly friendly strangers offering unsolicited help or trying to involve you in street games. These can often be scams. Trust your gut instinct.\n- **Language Barriers:** While English is widely spoken, especially in tourist areas, don't assume everyone will understand you. Have a translation app handy or a small phrasebook. Patience and clear communication are key.\n- **Different Customs and Etiquette:** Research the local customs and etiquette of the countries you're visiting. Simple things like tipping practices or mealtime customs can vary greatly. Being respectful of local traditions is important.\n- **Navigating Public Transport:** While generally excellent, public transport systems can be confusing at first, especially in large cities. Plan your routes in advance, understand how to buy and validate tickets, and factor in potential delays.\n- **Strikes:** Strikes, particularly involving transportation, can be a reality in some European countries. Keep an eye on local news for any potential disruptions.\n- **Jet Lag:** It's a beast, especially coming from NYC to Europe. Try to adjust to the local time as quickly as possible. Get some sunlight upon arrival and try to stay awake until a reasonable bedtime.\n- **Over-Tourism:** In popular destinations during peak season, expect crowds. Be patient, try to visit popular sights early in the morning or late in the day, and explore lesser-known neighborhoods.\n\n### Bringing it All Together: Your Epic nyc to europe Journey\n\nSo there you have it – a comprehensive guide to getting from **nyc to europe** and making the most of your adventure. It’s a journey that promises history, culture, incredible food, and experiences that will stay with you long after you've returned to the hustle and bustle of the Big Apple. From the initial spark of an idea to the final farewell at the airport, every step of the process is part of the adventure. Remember to plan, be prepared for the unexpected, and most importantly, embrace the magic of exploring a new continent.\n\n### Conclusion: Until Next Time, Europe!\n\nStepping off that plane back in New York City, you'll likely be a little tired, potentially a little jet-lagged, but undoubtedly filled with incredible memories. You’ve successfully navigated the transatlantic leap, immersed yourself in diverse cultures, and broadened your horizons in ways that only travel can. The cobblestone streets, the ancient ruins, the scent of fresh pastries – they'll linger in your mind, a sweet reminder of your European escapade. Planning a trip from NYC to Europe might seem daunting at first, but with careful preparation and an adventurous spirit, it’s an absolutely achievable and richly rewarding experience. So, start dreaming, start planning, and get ready to say \"Bonjour,\" \"Ciao,\" \"Hallo,\" or whatever greeting awaits you on the other side of the Atlantic. Europe is waiting!",

Customers have consistently indicated that cheap is the most important factor. One way to accomplish this is to unbundle the things that were previously included in a ticket. ULCCs started this, and most airlines have copied.\n\nThe cheapest fares get you nothing more than a chair--usually in the middle--which is all that most people want. If you want specific seats, you now pay for them. You aren't paying to sit together--you're paying to select specific seats.\n\nSo yeah, you have to pay. Are you paying \"extra\"?

Add your hold bags now!**\"—which made it seem like I was securing the best possible price. Since many airlines increase prices after booking, I decided to add a 23kg hold bag for €64.49, even though I wasn’t completely sure I’d need a large suitcase.\n\nBut immediately after my reservation was confirmed, I discovered that the same luggage option was available for €54.99—ironically, a **\"-15%\" savings** instead!\n\nWhen I contacted EasyJet, their agent said baggage prices are \"dynamic.\" But if that’s the case, how can they justify using the word \"**save**\" when the price might actually drop later? Shouldn’t they clearly state upfront that luggage costs fluctuate and may be lower after booking? Instead, their messaging pressured me into thinking that if I didn’t buy now, I’d end up **paying more later**.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vz9ewyvuth6f1.png?width=1397&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b0a171e92149ffe6f137e5e178f29e040cfea96\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vs0tjtm7uh6f1.png?width=1397&format=png&auto=webp&s=320d69b8f40d599c255fcf3bd084559de97b329e\n\n\n\nHas anyone else experienced this?

For some context: I earn around £65k a year, currently living at home with my boyfriends family while we figure out if we rent again or buy. **Please help me decide the best card to get.**\n\nIf I got a credit card, I would do all the big purchases and would probably spend at least £1,000 a month on food, shopping, and eating out, some months more if we go somewhere special or I make a big one off purchase of around £5k. Travel/hols we probably spend around £7-8k annually including hotels (3-4 hols a year, one long haul the rest short). I am interested in an Amex but open to other options. \n\nI like the idea of lounge access and as we plan to move back to London and all our flights will be from either Heathrow or Gatwick we would make use of that however many times a year we are allowed. \n\nNarrowed down four Amex cards:\n\n\\- Platinum annual fee seems quite high - **do you think its worth it for me?** At the moment there is a 50k bonus points when you spend £6,000 in your first three months. Not sure I will spend that, but a family member is moving house and planning to spend £20k on a new kitchen..... I could give them my card?\n\n\\- Gold seems to me the best option. They have an offer at the moment of 20k points when you spend £3,000 in your first three months which I will be able to achieve. Also no annual fee for the first year. **Can someone explain what kind of things you can spend membership rewards on?** I know you can transfer to Avios but I mean other things. Can you book holidays? Buy from John Lewis, Amazon?\n\n\\- BA one also nice they have no annual fee. Current offer is collect 5,000 bonus Avios when you spend £2,000 in your first three months. I really like the idea of a companion voucher and should easily hit the £15k a year spending limit to achieve this. I don't fly BA or many of the partner airlines that often I will be honest. For short haul we go easyJet to save money but maybe worth paying the extra for a BA flight to get the Avios. And BA fly to loads of destinations so would make use of the companion voucher for long haul. \n\n\\- BA premium gives you the option to use your companion voucher on business class flights and you obviously get that bit more Avios for your spend...but it comes with the £300 annual fee. **Worth it?**\n\n**Finally, should I try stoozing?**\n\nThanks",

I made it to the gate about 25 minutes before departure — and was one of the last few to board. Then came the real scam.\n\nThe gate agent told me my bag didn’t fit. (For the record, it always fits — it’s a soft bag that meets their size limits. Sometimes you have to push it a bit into the basket, but it always goes.) But at Berlin Airport, they don’t even use the standard EasyJet sizing basket — they use a visual sign. So even if your bag sticks out by 2/3 cm because it was loosely packed they can just eyeball it and say “no.”I asked if I could quickly reorganize my stuff, but they refused — literally saying, \"You are paying now or you can't get on the flight.\" No flexibility, no reasonable conversation — just last-minute pressure tactics when they know you have no choice. To make it even more frustrating, once I boarded, I had no issue fitting my bag under the seat. The flight attendants raised no concerns about the bag’s size at all.\n\nI get that EasyJet’s business model is about squeezing every penny. But it still needs to be fair.\n* Intentionally slowing down queues\n* Having inconsistent rules across airports\n* Using different measurement tools\n* Then last-minute forcing you to pay at the gate\nIt’s just insane and frankly feels like a scam\n\n————————————————————-\nJust to provide a bit more context. I wore a button export backpack. From the website the laptop compartment measure is 38cm x 28cm. That’s the reason why I said it always fit if there is a measuring basket. ",

      "easyjet don’t overwork their pilots. easyJet have a fantastic fatigue reporting scheme, as do the vast majority of airlines in europe, where we can call in fatigued no questions asked. \n\nEvery airline in Europe has to abide by flight time limitations on hours, number of flights, days off, and rest periods, by year, month, and quarter. \n\nSome airlines you might get closer to those limits than others, but they’re absolutely hard limits that can never be exceeded. \n\nRegarding the documentaries, if I showed you a documentary of my normal day at work, you’d be bored as hell. \n\nIt would be lots of words you don’t understand, lots of small talk and lots of drinking coffee. \n\nIt would be the worst television you’ve ever seen 😂",
      "If EasyJet was not obeying crew rest requirements and exceeding duty limitations they would not be flying. Period. The regulating bodies do not mess around. \n\nThey are not overworking their pilots. You are anxious for no reason because you read a very misleading article.",
      "In terms of number of flights flown and passengers transported, easyJet and Ryanair are statistically the safest airlines in Europe. As a former easyJet employee I can also tell you that they don’t get anywhere close to exhausting the pilots. The legal limit for pilot hours per year is 900. EasyJet pilots average about 600-700 per year in my experience. The daily hour limits they use are also significantly more restrictive than the legal limits. \n\nEasyJet has also invested heavily in data collection and monitoring. This means that crew can and do raise concerns both before and after duties to highlight is they found it tiring or fatiguing. Furthermore that data is examined to look for trends. If a particular combination of flights generates more reports than others, it is changed. \n\nFinally, as with all airlines, calling out because you’re not fit is not questioned. If you call the crewing team and inform them you are fatigued they simply say, thanks for telling us, please remember to file the report and have a good rest. \n\nYou should also find it reassuring that easyJet is often the airline of choice for crew of other airlines. I once operated an easyJet flight where we worked out that 1/3 of the passengers on board were in fact crew from other airlines!! And these are not just crew from other European airlines but from airlines across the globe.",

    "title": "TIFU by using EasyJet",
    "text": "Hello Reddit!!! This is my first TIFU, and it's because I chose to fly EasyJet, even after a bunch of people told me to avoid it! I hope you all enjoy this story so here it begins.\n\n**UPDATES POSTED BELOW** \n\n**THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE KIND WORDS AND SUPPORT! We are looking into our rights and ways to get compensation for everything including our lost vacation time and wages. I had no idea this would blow up, I posted it because I needed somewhere to vent all this frustration and stress and felt like I really made a fuck up booking with them after being told not to. I have been given fantastic advice from a majority of you, we are both very heartfelt. For the small few of those that posted rude comments or suggested this is fake, believe what you want, but it's far from it. It's a fucking living nightmare we had to endure.**\n\n**WE HAVE FINALLY ARRIVED BACK HOME IN THE STATES ON THE 31ST!!**\n\nMy wife and I decided to take a trip to Amsterdam from the states this summer to visit family. During said trip we booked a seperate flight to London for 3 days. The 22nd-24th.  We arrived in Amsterdam on the 21st and left the next day, all went smooth. We enjoyed the city of London and visited pretty much all of it in the time we had. Then the chaos began.\n\nOn the 24th while at Gatwick Airport our flight to Amsterdam was canceled due to a fueling issue in Amsterdam, this was understandable as our flight home from Amsterdam was on the 28th, so no big deal; we'd catch another flight. My wife had purchased alcohol after security and was told by a manager we could get a free checked bag. After being in line at customer service for 3 hours the airline said the next flight was on the 26th and they had booked us for 2 nights at a hotel. When we arrived at the hotel they said we were booked for only 1 night and dinner was no longer being served.\n\nOn the 25th we went back to the airport to request another hotel since they had mistakingly booked just a night, and we had to wait another 5 hours in line. They eventually booked us a night at a different hotel. When we arrived at the hotel they told us nothing was booked, and to go back to EasyJet. We went back and had to wait another 3 hours, totalling 8. They apologized and said the confirmation was never sent. So a whole day of opportunity wasted. We got back to the hotel and missed half our food vouchers. \n\nOn the 26th we got to the airport and our flights were canceled again, due to weather issues. However employees told us it was due to a crew issue and other airlines were flying to Amsterdam without a problem. We had to stay in line again for 4 hours, only for them to tell us there were no available flights for a few days. We needed to be back in Amsterdam by the 28th. They hired a taxi, and drove us to Luton airport 2 hours away on the 27th. Another whole day wasted. \n\nOn the 27th when we arrived at Luton Airport we asked about our free checked bag we were promised on the 24th, and an employee told us \"I don't care what a random person or employee told you, it's not happening\". I tried to explain how we have had multiple canceled flights and the employee said \"I'm going to walk away now.\" I was about to get upset.. my wife made me walk away before it happened. We decided it wasn't worth our fight. Another hour at customer service. When we got to our hotel we were told we had problems with our food accommodations and had to argue there for half an hour, which then they only allowed us pizza for dinner. Whatever, it was food! Yet again, another day wasted. \n\nOn the 28th our 7 am flight was canceled again due to a crew issue we were told.. It was unbelievable. We had only gotten 4 hours of sleep. In response they put us on the 8 am flight. We ran to security, got to the gate and got loaded into a bus. After 20 minutes waiting to be driven to the plane our flight got canceled.. For the fourth time; and they announced it was a crew issue. We would now miss our flight home. When we got back into the airport the attendant told us to wait in an area to recieve further information. They had then come to us and told us they don't know where our checked bags went and may be lost and could take a few hours to have them returned. I was livid! This whole trip had become a comic book! We got our bags an hour later. We waited on customer service for another 3 hours and they told us we had to go 2 hours back to Gatwick Airport to catch a flight home and they would pay for our flight to the states. We called Norwegian, who we missed, and to reschedule our flights cost us 900 pounds, which we are hoping EasyJet will refund (they said they would, and wrote a notice in our account.. But who knows, my trust is gone). They drove us back to Gatwick and we stayed the night. \n\nSo now today, on the 29th, we were told we had no check in bags on our account. We explained our insane situation and they still were hesitant to check a bag for us at no cost. Eventually after a lengthy period of time they did. Now we await in the airport for our 5th flight to Amsterdam.. And hopefully then home. I won't ever choose this airline again. \n\nI understand the first cancelation, the second, third and fourth not at all. The people we dealt with were mostly aggressive, stressful, and non-caring. We totalled 19 hours dealing with customer service, we were told different things by different employees, failures in bookings, missed accommodations, etc.\n\n**UPDATE 1: Loaded onto a bus for the 5th flight and have turned around due to a technical failure on the plane! Currently in a permanent delay!! 5 flights!!!**\n\n**UPDATE 2: They are trying to divert a new plane for us to use.. May be another canceled**\n\n**UPDATE 3: FINALLY ARRIVED IN AMSTERDAM! It took EasyJet an additional 2 hours to get us a new plane and allow us to fly to Amsterdam, they weren't allowed any discretion to give us free water or snacks and were demanding it be charged even after everything. At any rate, now I need to wait a few days to fly home.. Hopefully that doesn't get fucked!!**\n\n**UPDATE 4: ARRIVED HOME ON THE 31ST!**\n\n**UPDATE  - Regarding other forms of transporation**\n\nSome of you were asking about the Ferry and the Train. On the 25th Eurostar had 2 lines shut down due to excessive heat frying the wires, there were no available tickets for the days I needed. The ferry, also sold out. \n\nIn terms of a car rental, It was possible to rent a car last minute but were told it must be returned in Belgium first, and then another car must be rented to return in Amsterdam. Not only did they want a shit ton of money but they also told us a car rental to drop off in Amsterdam wasn't available.. \n\nTo get a plane directly to JFK from a local airport last minute was starting at 1600 pounds per person, and they were connecting 22h+ flights. Not worth it. Direct flights were over 2200 pounds. Rescheduling Norwegian from AMS to Gatwick wasn't possible either, as they wanted 1600 pounds per ticket to change the time and airport. We had to pay 500 pounds a person just for a reschedule at Amsterdam.. \n\n\n\nTL;DR - Stuck in England from the 24th-29th, 4 canceled flights at 2 different airports with EasyJet. Driven to another airport and then back to the original airport. Three cancelations likely from crew issues. Miss managed accommodations, rude and aggressive employees, rescheduling our flights home, lost baggage (was found eventually)... What a trip! **Read the updates!**",

    "title": "Easyjet forced me to sleep in a room with a stranger or 'sleep in the lobby' when travelling solo after my flight was cancelled, can I do anything about this?",
    "text": "I (27 F) had an easyjet flight travelling from Croatia to Gatwick which was cancelled after waiting 18 hours at the airport.\n\nAt 3.18am we boarded a bus to a hotel.\n\nAt 3.55am we arrived at the hotel and were told by staff to provide our passports to check in. A man who was organising the group asked everyone who needed single occupancy, four of us did, two girls and a man, the man who asked us then left on a phone call. The first group were then informed only double rooms were available and they would have to split up. A woman in the group protested and the crowd asked why this was happening, the man in charge then told us that double rooms were the only option. The crowd again protested this. \n\n \n\nTwo girls who did not know each other finally gave in and said they would share a room. I explained to the man in charge (I think he was the hotel manager) that I was a single female and the only other solo passenger was a male, I did not know this man. I explained how inappropriate it was that we were being asked to share with a stranger. I was then told by the man in charge that the only other option was to sleep in the lobby of the hotel. \n\n \n\nThe crowd was getting angry as we were holding up the line. I was angry too, and exhausted, it was 4.15am at this point. The other solo male passenger finally gave in and told the hotel staff he would be willing to share with me if it was the only option. I thought about staying in the lobby but I was too exhausted. I tried again to plead for my own room. After arguing and going back and forth I asked the hotel receptionist if we could at least have separate single beds. I got so embarrassed, I am not a confrontational person. The receptionist said he could not guarantee two single beds. A few other passengers tried to help me, but most were exhausted and I was very aware that I was holding up the crowd from getting into their rooms. \n\nLuckily the double bed could be separated into two. Once finally in bed at 4.30am I cried quietly out of frustration. Although exhausted I did not sleep as I felt scared (the man was very nice but I was sleeping with a stranger in a small room). The morning was awkward and uncomfortable.  There was a wake up call at 8am. I left the room in a rush as I did not want to have any more time with a stranger I did not know in such a confined space. I got changed in the bathroom and ended up accidentally leaving some things in the room.\n\nWe finally departed back home at 12pm the next day.\n\nI have filled out a compensation form for the flight and have sent easyjets customer service team a email complaint.\n\nI am not sure of what kind of response I am expecting back from easyjet, but is there anything I can do legally?\n\n\n\nUPDATE: so easyjet replied to my email asking for more details, I responded and they took 2 weeks to reply to me so I went to the media. My story got published in The Sun and they paid me a decent amount for it. After that easyjet responded offering a refund for the flight. I really appreciate all the responses and hope that something like this won’t happen again, thank you everyone!",

Even without this, I think there would be a solid argument that the requirement was discriminatory towards you as a woman.\n\nBut ultimately, unless you're willing to test it in court...\n\nDefinitely pursue the complaint, though.\n\nIf it happens again, which is vanishingly unlikely, I'd take the position that they have been unable to provide you with suitable hotel accommodation so you'll be checking into a different hotel and pursuing them for the cost, which is a claim I would expect you to win.",

They never did.\n\nI made a report with Sussex police, who are responsible for policing at Gatwick, and they replied that they don't think anything criminal occurred and closed the report. I've emailed Easyjet, who claim they're taking the issue very seriously and then go silent until I email them again, at which point I'm told the issue is being taken very seriously.\n\nI've since learned the same thing happened to [another traveller flying from Gatwick the day before](https://www.reddit.com/r/passportcanada/comments/1k4027y/comment/mpigf0r/?context=3). We were both flying early in the morning, bleary eyed and easily distracted.\n\nIt seems ridiculous to have to write this, but make sure you get your passport back. if a gate agent doesn't give you back your passport and it then disappears, there are no consequences for the gate agent, the airport or the airline.",

In the space of ten minutes ‘someone had handed it in as they found it on the floor’. I was sent to the staff security point to collect it and while there chatted to some of the guys on the scanners.

A man who was organising the group asked everyone who needed single occupancy, four of us did, he then left on a phone call. The first group were then informed only double rooms were available and they would have to split up. A woman in the group protested and the crowd asked why this was happening, the man in the black shirt (the only one who seemed in charge) said that double rooms were the only option. The crowd again protested this. \n\n \n\nTwo girls who did not know each other finally gave in and said they would share a room. I explained to the man in charge (I think he was the hotel manager) that I was a single female and the only other solo passenger was a male, I did not know this man. I explained how inappropriate it was that we were being asked to share with a stranger. I was then told by the man in black that the only other option was to sleep in the lobby of the hotel. \n\n \n\nThe crowd was getting angry as we were holding up the line. I was angry too, and exhausted, it was 4.15am at this point. The other solo male passenger finally gave in and told the hotel staff he would be willing to share with me if it was the only option. I thought about staying in the lobby but I was too exhausted. I tried again to plead for my own room. After arguing and going back and forth I asked the hotel receptionist if we could at least have separate single beds. I get so embarrassed, I am not a confrontational person. The receptionist said he could not guarantee two single beds. A few other passengers tried to help me, but most were exhausted and I was very aware that I was holding up the crowd from getting into their rooms. \n\nLuckily the double bed could be separated into two. Once finally in bed at 4.30am I cried quietly out of frustration. Although exhausted I did not sleep as I felt scared (the man was very nice but I was sleeping with a stranger in a  small room). The morning was awkward and uncomfortable.  There was a wake up call at 8am. I left the room in a rush as I did not want to have any more time with a stranger I did not know in such a confined space. I got changed in the bathroom and ended up accidentally leaving some things in the room.\n\nWe finally departed back home at 12pm the next day.\n\nI have filled out a compensation form for the flight and have sent easyjets cuctomer service team a email complaint.\n\nI am not sure of what kind of response I am expecting back from easyjet, but is there anything I can do legally?",

      "Ohne Paywall:\nhttps://archive.is/Ezk38\n*Original auf Handelsblatt erschienen\n\n„Grund dafür sind die horrenden Zugangskosten, die von der deutschen Regierung und dem Flughafenmanagement nicht gesenkt werden konnten“, begründet das Unternehmen den Teilrückzug. Der britische Rivale Easyjet hat seine in Berlin stationierte Flotte bereits zum Winterflugplan 2022/2023 von 18 auf elf Flugzeuge reduziert. Auch Lufthansa hat das Angebot an vielen deutschen Flughäfen verringert.\n\nDie hohen staatlichen Kosten lassen die Gewinne der Fluggesellschaften gerade auf Kurz- und Mittelstrecken abschmelzen. Verbindungen lohnen sich häufig nicht mehr. Dazu kommt: Weil Fluggerät wegen der Liefer- und Technikprobleme derzeit knapp ist, werden die verfügbaren Jets lieber auf den lukrativen Strecken eingesetzt.\n\nJe nach Flughafen sind die staatlichen Gebühren gegenüber dem Vorkrisenjahr 2019 tatsächlich deutlich gestiegen, teilweise haben sie sich fast verdoppelt. Ein typischer Flug mit einem Airbus A320 kostete zum Beispiel in Düsseldorf im Jahr 2019 laut Branchenverband BDL 2227 Euro. Im Mai dieses Jahres musste eine Fluggesellschaft dafür 4390 Euro bezahlen, ein Plus von 97 Prozent.\n\nIn Frankfurt beträgt der Zuwachs bei den Gebühren 53 Prozent, in München und Berlin 66 Prozent und in Hamburg 75 Prozent......\n\n..\n\n....„Der Luftverkehrsstandort Deutschland fällt unter das Niveau des Jahres 2013 zurück. Reisende haben weniger Flugstrecken zur Auswahl als vor zehn Jahren“, sagt Beisel. Es gebe kein Nachfrage-, sondern ein klares Angebotsproblem. Eine Wettbewerbsgleichheit mit den europäischen Nachbarn könne nur durch eine signifikante Reduzierung der staatlichen Belastungen gelingen, so Beisel weiter. Und damit auch wieder eine größere Angebotsauswahl für die Fluggäste hierzulande.",

He was kept in a police cell for two days and was later released on bail, the court was told.\nBack in the UK, he was questioned by the British intelligence agencies MI5 and MI6, before he returned home to Orpington, Kent.\nAppearing in court on Monday, Mr Verma - who is now studying economics at Bath University - said the message was \"a joke in a private group setting\".\n\"It was just sent to my friends I was travelling with on the day,\" he said.\nPressed about the purpose of the message, Mr Verma said: \"Since school, it's been a joke because of my features... It was just to make people laugh.\n\nAsked what he thought when he saw the fighter jets flanking the plane, Mr Verma said: \"The Russia-Ukraine war was happening so I thought it was a military exercise related to [that] conflict.\"\nHe said that the plane's pilot made an announcement, telling passengers that the fighter jets had been scrambled because of a distress signal that had been sent by mistake.\nPolice experts told the court that they combed Mr Verma's phone and, although they found that he had researched clashes between Pakistan and India and the possibilities of an Islamic State attack in that area, they did not find anything of interest that linked Mr Verma to jihadist radicalism.\nMr Verma is not facing terrorism charges or a possible jail term, but could be fined up to €22,500 (£19,300) if found guilty and the Spanish defence ministry is demanding €95,000 in expenses.\nThe court told the BBC that a verdict in Mr Verma's case would come in the next few days. - \n\n[By Laura Gozzi BBC News 22 January 2024](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68056421)\n\nand the video is from Instagram  [@rt](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2cPAMhLtMi/?igsh=MWJkdGI1MW9pMHluMQ==)",

But I’ve seen videos of this happen, usually from the airport handlers (who I believe get commission) such as Swissport - noticeably in Manchester for example. \n\nEasyjet has maybe marginally better service. Personally I’ve had ok service when things go wrong on Ryanair, which to be fair is infrequent for how often I fly with them. Ie when I’ve had a flight cancelled (in advance) it’s been reasonably painless to rebook. On day cancellations are hell though.

The planes are fairly modern- not because they want to give you a better experience, but because they don't want to pay for fuel on an inefficient engine.\n\nIt's a no frills glorified bus service, and I am so happy they exist.\n\nEven Singapore Air charges to pick a seat now."

    "text": "\"A lot has been written about getting on the housing ladder in the last 24 hours, mostly by people who never struggled to take that step.  So, this is a small example of what it's like today, to save for your first home, with some of the 'techniques' being thrown at the young people trying to take that step for themselves.\n\nFirst up, some numbers. The average first-time buyer's property in England is £224k.  You'll need a 10% deposit as a first-time buyer (you CAN get a 95% mortgage if you shop around, but you'll get screwed on the rates, which will cost you even more over time).  So realistically, that's £22k you need to save for the average first-time house. It's at least double that for London.\n\nNow, as Kirstie Allsopp generously explained, there ARE steps you can take to save the money you need, so:\n\nDrop your daily coffee = £3 a day, 20 days a month = £720 a year\nCancel Netflix = £6 a month = £72 a year\nCancel your Gym membership = £50 a month = £600 a year\nDon't take that Easyjet holiday with your mates in Spain = £700\n\nThat's a total saving of almost £2,100.  That's pretty good. That's quite a lot of extra cash to have saved over a single year. Some sacrifice, yes, but a nice extra sum.\n\nHowever, here's the rub.  House prices last year went up by 10%  so your deposit requirement went up to £24,200 - a rise of £2,200.\n\nSo, now you're sat there, after a year of giving up many things you like, after a year of belt-tightening and less enjoyment in your social life, and you've done ALL of that to find yourself £100 FURTHER AWAY from your deposit requirement than you were a year ago.\n\nUnless, of course, your Dad is a multi-millionaire Baron.\" \n\nNewsThump",

      "Theres another factor that isn't often mentioned here too, and thats that the buying power of families relative to single people is double what it was in generations past because it is now typical that both men and women will have full time jobs.\n\nSince the housing market is a competitive enterprise, the greater buying power of couples drives up the price that can be paid for a house that a couple would move into compared to what it was in past generations.\n\nYou aren't going to have a good time even if you are on a £40,000 wage and try and compete for starter houses against a couple both on £28,000. Not only is that a combined salary of £56,000 but they also pay less income tax because they both benefit from the approx first £10,000 being tax free. Much more spending power.\n\nSo single people and single income families are basically priced out of the market, as they can only afford half of the first time Buy potential as a typical starter family.\n\nThere is of course inflation pressures, buy to let, mass migration vs house building rate, pressure on city centres for jobs and a raft of other wonderful factors too, but dual wage families is a massive one I rarely see discussed, particularly with how many more women are in well paying white collar jobs over the last generation rather than house wives or taking temp jobs to supplement a main income as was typical generations back.\n\nNot a moral stance in this post taken, just an observation of cause and effect.",

If you're correct about visa requirements, you will be eligible for UK261 compensation of £350. You should also make a [welfare](https://www.easyjet.com/en/claim/welfare) claim for the new plane tickets (although I'm unsure how Dohop connections work and if, as I suspect, only LIS–LGW is eligible it gets complicated), plus all meals and refreshments from the time of departure of your original flight until the time you arrived at OSL (again, complicated by your destination not being London)\n\nI recently made an EC261 claim with easyJet and they were super fast in processing the compensation and expenses and making payment. Hopefully, the experience will be similar for you, although your case is far less straightforward than an overnight delay on a point-to-point ticket.\n\nShould easyJet not respond within eight weeks, deny your claim, or offer less than you believe correct, escalate to the approved [adjudicator](https://www.aviationadr.org.uk/completing-the-form-eu/) and they will determine your case.

      "Airlines are at their discretion in refusing to transport a pax due to immigration concerns. Your connecting flight is not on the same ticket so they are not sure if you will depart UK or not. If you somehow want to illegally stay in  the UK, the airline is heavily fined. \n\nThe best you can do is to reach to customer service for compensation. If they deny, the only option is the court.\n\nTo save some effort, buy through ticket without using ota next time.",

The delays continued throughout the day and knocked on to later flights. Ultimately and in the case of this flight, it pushed the operating crew out of their legal working hours. We do take reasonable measures to avoid delays and cancellations to our flights by having replacement crews and spare aircraft available in our network. In the circumstances, our standby crew had already been deployed onto other flights. We had no option but to cancel your flight.”\n\nFrom what I’ve read, easyJet not having replacement crews is not an acceptable reason to use the ‘extraordinary circumstances’ defence.\n\nWhat should I do now? I could write to the regulator, try using a no win no fee solicitors, or just leave it.’.",

      "If you have checked luggage or forget to check in online, these 120€ will melt away fast.",
      "In terms of the budget airlines, everyone has their own preference, mostly informed by their own previous experiences with airlines - \"Ryanair robbed me for my bag that was 99% inside the sizer\" or \"Easyjet was 2 hours late and made us miss a meal reservation\" - or so on... The important thing to note is that both Easyjet and Ryanair operate very similar business models, and in terms of their rules there's going to be far more variation between enforcement at different airports than for the different companies. Due to European flight compensation regulations, you'll eventually manage to get your money back and/or get to your destination if you're heavily delayed or the flight's cancelled with the length of that delay usually more due to the number of alternate routes from your starting airport than the operator.\n\nA few things to note are that delays for budget airlines (esp Ryanair in my experience) are far more likely at the end of the day than the beginning. This is due to their aircraft having to make more \"hops\" in a single day, with less time on the ground as a buffer for delays, I'm often prepared to suffer an early-morning flight for this reason. For flights in any country it's \\*usually\\* better to fly from an airport where the airline has a base, this is due to the availability of replacement aircraft/crew and better ground service. I would disregard this completely for Ryanair and mostly for Easyjet, as they have lots of very small bases with few aircraft, and none that will be available as a backup.   \nWithout knowing the specific airports/cities you're flying too/from it's difficult to say, but in terms of big Portuguese airports I'd usually say resilience will be better in Lisbon for Easyjet, and Porto+Faro for Ryanair. \n\nOne thing that's more of an issue in Europe than the US is crappily located airports, particularly for some places in Italy like Milan and Venice. Make sure you check how you're getting to/from the airports before clicking \"book\".\n\nI would also try looking at the flight numbers you're considering on a tracker app like flightradar24 and check the history to see how often they're delayed or cancelled, I find more problematic routes than problematic airlines.\n\nI rarely go for the airlines by brand name unless I have to be somewhere at \\*exactly\\* the right time on a tight schedule. There's few \"premium\" airlines out there that make any effort to outplay their competitors in service and even the priciest will happily try to shave off margins while charging you inflated prices in a race to the bottom. It's true that budget airlines will try to recoup money on the cheap-up-front prices with baggage costs and fees, but so do all of them these days. Hold luggage tends to be quite steep on budget airlines, but cabin bags aren't so bad if you can manage lugging them through the airport. I'd say the only guarenteed advantage is that I've never seen a premium airline have fees for checking in at the airport (I prefer to do it in advance on my phone anyway).\n\nPersonally I would rate Ryanair over Easyjet. This is because I find the Ryanair phone app to be better, and because Easyjet can overbook planes (hoping that some passengers won't show at the gate, which does usually happen). I'm on high-demand Easyjet routes like Gatwick-Geneva quite frequently, and never been bumped, but it can be a concern on high-demand routes at busy times.\n\nIn terms of whether you should pay the extra for TAP, I'd go through the checkouts for all airlines (preferably in incognito off your home network) and add in all the extras you might need. I would value any extra service like free snacks and slightly comfier seats from an airline quite low for such a short flight, but maybe the better timing of the departures is worth it for you?\n\nHope you enjoy Portugal!",
      "Check the details before you decide. Ryanair or EasyJet are fine for short hops but they are ultra strict on baggage mostly (weight AND dimensions), and if there are delays you are on your own. Tap is a more pleasant experience - more flexible with handluggage . Prices might be similar by the time you compare like with like including luggage and taxes",

    "text": "I was scheduled to fly within the EU yesterday, a flight under 1500km, not departing from or arriving in the UK.\n\nDue to a cabin crew member falling ill, the airline (EasyJet) asked for 30 volunteers to be offloaded. The offer was £400 (approximately €480), a rebooking on the next available flight, hotel accommodation, and meals. The next available flight turned out to be almost three days later. Initially, around 15 people volunteered. The airline then announced that if another 15 people did not volunteer within the next few minutes, they would involuntarily deny boarding to the last 15 passengers who had checked in. Those passengers would only receive €250 in compensation. Fortunately for the airline, enough people were pressured into volunteering, bringing the total to 30.\n\nI was one of the volunteers, and the situation deteriorated rapidly. There was no EasyJet desk at the airport (despite it being the capital city's main airport), leaving us with no one to speak to regarding the next steps. There was a shared desk for several low-cost airlines, including EasyJet, but the staff there clarified that they were not EasyJet employees.\n\nThey made the process extremely difficult for us. Initially, they claimed to have no information and told us to call EasyJet's UK number. When we called, EasyJet either hung up, claimed we were not registered when we provided our names, or stated that it was the responsibility of the airport desk. The desk staff refused to take any action or contact EasyJet themselves. They repeatedly left the desk area and locked themselves in their office.\n\nAfter five hours (!) of arguing at the desk, they finally registered our names. From that point, EasyJet was able to assist us via phone and rebook us on a flight two days later.\n\nHowever, this is far from satisfactory. It deviates significantly from the promises made by the crew member initially, who assured us that everything would be taken care of. We had to book our own hotels, pay for our own meals, and so on. While they promised reimbursement, this was not the original agreement. They are only offering £25 per day for food, which is insufficient in the capital of one of the most expensive countries in the world.\n\nI apologize if this is a bit confusing. Are they within their rights to do this, or am I entitled to extra compensation for the situation (considering the threats of denied boarding and the discrepancy between the initial promises and the actual treatment we received)?\n\n. \n\nTLDR: My EasyJet flight within the EU was overbooked. They asked for 30 volunteers to be offloaded, promising €480, a new flight, hotel, and meals. When not enough volunteered, they threatened to involuntarily deny boarding to the last 15 check-ins, who would only get €250. I volunteered, but then EasyJet made it incredibly difficult. There was no EasyJet staff at the airport, and the shared desk staff were unhelpful and refused to contact EasyJet. After 5 hours of arguing, they finally registered us so EasyJet could rebook us (2 days later). We had to book our own hotels and meals, contrary to the initial promise, and they're only offering £25/day for food, which isn't enough. Are they allowed to do this, or am I entitled to more compensation due to their threats and the difference between what was promised and what I received?\n\n. \n\nThank you!",

      "I sympathize with your ... odyssey, I really do! I've been in such situations and it really sucks.\n\nUnfortunately this is one of the biggest problems with Low Cost Carriers (LCC's): When things dont go as planned, there simply arent enough people and/or a robust system to help passengers out. And it looks like you saw this first hand.\n\nNow, since you voluntarily took the deal I dont think you can do much except take the compensation you agreed. You can always complain to easyjet and see if they will agree to increase it a bit and/or give you some freebies\n\nFor future reference, if you were involuntarily denied boarding you could still take some cash, but also you'd be entitled to go to your destination using any carrier possible, and easyjet would be liable to pay for that ticket (on top of possible transfer costs, meals, hotels etc). At least this is for EU 261, not sure for UK 261",
      "As a rule of thumb for the future - don't volunteer unless you have already agreed on the new flight you are taking.\n\nI volunteer pretty regularly because it works well for my schedule -- but many times I have volunteered, gone up to the ticket counter, and then it turns out that I can't get another ticket to my destination in time. You're perfectly free to stop volunteering at that time.",
      "Yes it is legal. They're offering you more than your legal entitlement to volunteer or they'll deny boarding and pay out the legal minimum. \n\nOf course it is legal, if they can't get you on then they cannot get you on. \n\nIf you're a cabin crew member down, it means you have to potentially cut the number of passengers for safety reasons. \n\nWhen I was cabin crew for Ryanair, it was around 50 or so passengers per cabin crew member.",
      "Sorry for the hassle. There are some LCC routes that I have to fly and overbook, and I chuck a bag in the hold every time to ensure I'm never offboarded.",
      "Yes it is legal, otherwise the only option would be to cancel the flight completely causing more issues.\n\nEasyJet have a duty of care to provide accommodation, food and transport to/from the above accommodation. When my flight has been cancelled we were able to book a hotel through the app. Because your flight wasn’t cancelled I wonder if that function was not made available. \n\nThat duty of care more and more has been placed on the customer to find accommodation, food and transport and then told to claim it back. EasyJet have a page with reasonable/acceptable amounts on their page. \n\nSo correct me if I’m wrong but you should be able to put in for (1) EU261 delayed flight compensation + (2) amount promised at gate + reasonable expenses.\n\nIn terms of staff at airport, no airline has its own staff at every out station. This is usually contracted out to an external ground handler. The contract will likely provide staff for the check in open - aircraft departs window, but nothing outside then"

I cannot see where the 3x price comes from (it's even the same A319 plane).\n\n2) Service: EasyJet's onboard menu is much broader than BA, price is similar and BA had \"run out\" of numerous items.\n\n3) People: On budget airlines most people know the drill, get from A to B with the least hassle. On BA you have business travellers who are the same, and, the \"entitled\" people (mostly a common demographic and age group) who faf around, have a tantrum when they cant get their bag directly above their seat and struggle to sit where their ticket says. Overall boarding seems to take a lot longer with BA (same aircraft).\n\n4) Arrival: At Heathrow everything takes longer, deboarding, immigration queues and leaving the airport.\n\nI don't understand how BA manage to charge so much more for nothing extra.

      "You're not comparing like with like.\n\nBA is a long haul airline. Its short haul network feeds its and its partners' long haul networks.\n\nPricing is different. For example, pricing may reflect selling to a p2p passenger means selling one less connecting passenger, which may be higher yield.\n\nAlso, since business travellers use the p2p service that BA does compete on, they're able to get away with charging much more. But then you may as well see it as a business service. As a business traveller, you earn rewards and probably have status. BA short haul economy with status is massively better than a LCC, especially when your employer pays - you get lounge, fast track, preferred seating, etc.\n\nBA aren't really interested in occasional low yield short haul traffic. Although they do compete with this on some routes. But even on those routes, it's alongside the corporate and connecting markets. Amsterdam is a good example of competing on corporate, connecting and the LCC. You can see pricing for different BA flights in different combinations addressing these different market segments.\n\nLCC aim to fill their aeroplanes. BA don't necessarily aim for high load factors on every flight, especially short haul. Try the 6am from Heathrow to Madrid. it's often not busy, but it's purpose is purely for connectors. The 7am out of Madrid back to London in contrast, is absolutely packed. And nearly everyone is a connector from an arriving Iberia long haul. BA may price p2p travellers off these flights.\n\nHeathrow isn't really an airport for short haul. It's really great for long haul.",
      "On BA you likely get more baggage bundled in with your fare which can be a big cost for people who need it on easyJet and needs to be factored in, along with other smaller things such as T5 being a significantly nicer terminal than either of the Gatwick ones as well as the fact BA offer a loyalty program, but yes if you live local to Gatwick, easyJet is probably the easier option for you, and on the flip side the same would be true for people living local to Heathrow wanting to fly BA.",
      "I recently switched from Ryanair to BA after unintentionally getting gold status.\n\nBA is not much better at the economy level for low status holders.\n\nBIG HOWEVER, with luggage they are often the same price, and twice I have screwed up and missed flights, both times BA took pity and put me on another flight for free. Easy or Ryanair would be laughing till the end of their shift if I asked them.\n\nFlying BA with good status is another thing though, night and day. I often fly from terminal 3 mostly and going to the Cathay first class lounge and getting a free a la carte dinner for me and a guest when travelling economy, having the seat next to me usually blocked in economy and all the nicer treatment makes it worth it IMO"

      "So last time I answered a similar question I got downvoted to hell, but let's try again.\n\nYes you should have your passport on you in case of a police check or anything. These can happen even within Schengen but are very rare. Getting caught without passport may have consequences for you should you happen to get caught.\n\nHowever, the airline doesn't care about your passport for any legal reasons. They only care if you are the person who bought the ticket, since people reselling their tickets would harm their business model. Legacy carriers (who don't allow paid name change) often don't even check ID on Schengen flights at all, but lowcost carriers tend to.\n\nI don't know what the passport card looks like but if it looks official enough and will leave the agent without doubt you are the one whose name is on the ticket, I am quite sure they won't care. They are not paid enough to care and have no reason to add more work for themselves. They may be financially motivated to detect people's oversized bags (which makes money for airline) but not for spending time analyzing your ID, which, even in case of your refusal, won't make any money to them and will just waste time.\n\nI have flown with a drivers licence a few times within Schengen a few times without any issues. Which is not considered a valid ID either.\n\nSo while you should have your passport for multiple reasons, my guess is there is 90 % chance you will be alright. Just check in online.",

      "Our honeymoon:\n\n\n- When we landed in Vietnam, we discovered the travel agent had messed up our visas and the dates were wrong. We had to ask to get our visa extended in Vietnam. \n\n\n- We wasted 1 day going to whatever government building we were told would renew our visa. The officers didn't want to renew our visa there. They sent us to another travel agency. (They are corrupt and instead of charging you the official 30quid, they send you to a travel agency where they charge you 90 so the officer gets 30, the travel agent 30 plus the official 30). \n\n\n- Guy in travel agency wanted to scam us for even more money. Nice lady from another travel agency is on the phone translating for us. She warns us about the scam and tells us to go to another office\n\n\n- The office is in another city. A city we didn't plan to visit at all. We had to change plans and flights to get there and, finally, extend our visa. Another day lost. \n\n\n- Our lovely 3 day cruise got cut short because the whole bay was evacuated due to a \"mega typhoon\" coming. We decided to flee the area asap and booked an early flight away from the region.\n\n\n- We were trapped on an 9 hour night bus... A bus that had beds for maybe 30, but was full to the brim. 4-5 people seating on each bedz seating packed on the corridor. We were seated right behind the driver seat. Not on a seat behind the driver. No. On the actual floor, in the space between the driver's seat and the front row. 9 hours of the driver's seat banging on hour legs, with nowhere to rest our backs against (apart from other seated people). All of that while driving in pitch dark roads 2 inches away from the cliff and while enjoying a concert of 5-6 people constantly puking. Puking on paper bags. Paper bags that were handed from person to person to the driver, for the driver to throw them out of the window. They were the longest and hardest 9 hours of my life. Instead of sleeping like planned, I spend the whole 9 hours crying and going in and out of anxiety attacks. \n\n\n- We had everything planned to finish our trip with a week in a remote island in Cambodia. I had researched the flights, the times for the ferry when we landed, paid for the stay at the island... Only to find they cancelled all flights to the city we needed. 3 days before actually flying there. Cue to panic attack at a hotel lobby, frantically looking for a similar alternative within Vietnam. \n\n\n- Other minor things included: wasting several hours walking to visit something but being turned around because my outfit wasn't appropriate enough, a sleepless night due to mosquitoes and a lady banging some pots and bells (?), sitting on a flight next to a man clipping his toenails, ....\n\n\nWe literally spend all the trip solving issues. We came back home completely exhausted. \n\n\nThis was 5 years ago. The other day, my husband mentioned wanting to go back because \"we had fun, right?\". I hesitated between screaming and crying lol"

If you do use EasyJet again, next time I’d encourage you to compare the prices between the two options above. If you’re not bothered about speedy boarding and seats, I think it’s cheaper if you add the large cabin bag as a standalone.\n\n---\n\n[_^(What is this?)_](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/jjrte1/askuk_hits_200k_new_feature_mark_an_answer/)",

      "Speedy Boarding is often bundled with any premium extras like extra bags, paying for a exit seat etc.  So it's likely that (I see you mentioned in comments you added an overhead bag).\n\n\nThey will call speedy boarding first (and it'll be like half the plane).  They are usually quite strict in not letting non speedy boarders 'sneak' through so it's unlikely your partner can join.  So you have to choose between either boarding separately or waiting and boarding with your partner.\n\n\nControversially:  in your shoes I would board with the speedy boarding lot.  I say this as you say you have an overhead bag.  If you wait to board with everyone else, there is a chance that you won't be able to find a convenient place to store it overhead and risk having to put your bag miles down the back of the plane (which will then limit the speed you can disembark and put you at the back of any passport queues etc).",

      "The height of the 26 is much bigger than the personal item allowance for those airlines.

To recap briefly, my flight within the EU was overbooked due to a sick flight attendant, and EasyJet asked for 30 volunteers to take a later flight 2 days later. They explicitly promised 480€ in compensation, along with a rebooking, hotel, and meals, to anyone who volunteered. \n\nEdit for clarification: When not enough people volunteered, he announced that if the quota wasn't met in X minutes, some would be involuntarily denied boarding with 250€ compensation instead of the 480€ offered for volunteering.

Word to the wiser-than-me—don’t book with EasyJet Worldwide/Dohop.\n\n\n-Booked flights to a Greek island with EasyJet and Sky Express for June. \n-Both EasyJet flights times changed (delayed) by 5hrs 15mins. \n-Departing flight from Basel to Athens will now land after the (non)connecting flight departs, in the evening so we would have to stay the night in Athens and change our Sky Express flight for the following day. We are traveling with a baby, so this is really not ideal/would also be missing out on a night of our trip on the island where we already have accommodations booked.\n-Returning flight would have an 8+ hour layover and arrive around 10:00 pm, then we are a 2-hr ride home from the airport. Again, not ideal with a baby, or even without for that matter.\n-Dohop says they can’t help me since I didn’t purchase insurance. \n-I submitted a claim with EasyJet and I’m waiting, but curious if this has happened to anyone else and if this falls under the EU261 protection. If so, both flights? Only EasyJet? Can Dohop do anything if I purchase the insurance now? So frustrating. \n\nOur only option now is to purchase another flight from a different airport and airline if we want to make our connection in Athens, and the flight is of course 400+ EUR per person.

    "text": "Last month my partner and I were delayed 3+ hours travelling from Hurghada to Gatwick. Flight was delayed due to extraordinary circumstances according to them. I put in  a claim and they've refused. This is their justification.\n\n\"Compensation Claim Assessment\nWe always review claims fairly and in keeping with EU/UK regulation.  We always aim to provide the best possible experience when flying with us, however, from time-to-time situations arise which are outside of our control and unfortunately when this happens we are unable to offer compensation.\n\nTo further explain what happened on the day; air traffic control restrictions at Hurghada (HRG) substantially regulated the air space due to capacity/staffing issues, which resulted in diverting the flight to Nice (NCE). Once in Nice (NCE) there was a delay in awaiting weather improvement before continuing on to London Gatwick (LGW). The delays continued throughout the day and knocked on to later flights. Ultimately and in the case of this flight, the delay pushed our crew into their maximum legal operating hours. There are strict industry wide rules on the number of hours our crew are allowed to work. To protect the safety of our customers and crew, these hours cannot be exceeded. We do take reasonable measures to avoid delays and cancellations to our flights by having replacement crews and spare aircraft available in our network. In the circumstances, a replacement crew was deployed to operate this flight and were called out from home standby/repositioned from an alternative base.\"\n\nFrom what I understand easyJet not having replacement crews is not an acceptable reason to use the \"extraordinary circumstances\" defence.\n\nIf there were delays throughout the day they should have had staff ready to deploy earlier.\n\nWhat should I do now? Should I reply to them or try the regulator? I'm happy to use a solicitor which is no win no fee.\n\nAny thoughts appreciated. Thanks 👍",

As we have established, air traffic control issues are out with the airline's control, but making the decision to simply ignore a known issue and not arrange a replacement crew *is* within their control and they should be responsible in that case.\n\nMy plan is to go through their internal complaints procedure, if I don't get a result I'm happy with ask them for a deadlock letter and then go to their alternative dispute recognition scheme which I think is AviationADR.\n\nUnlikely a solicitor will add anything, they would just be taking money to do all the same things you can do on your own.

So I guess it’s personal preference.\n\nGood luck!",
      "Let it go.\n\nEvidently they did their best in the circumstances (which do appear to be out of Easyjet’s hands) and had a replacement crew ready. As other commenters have pointed out, it’s not feasible or expected that every airline has replacement crews on-call at every airport.\n\nYou can try the ombudsman but I think you will end up having to put this one down to rotten luck and moving on with your life."
