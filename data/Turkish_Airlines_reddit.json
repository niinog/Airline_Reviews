      "These are all questions about the mileage program themselves rather than revpoints.\n\nThe revpoints can be converted to airline miles, that's correct. But what you can do with the airline miles and their worth, is all depending on the mile program you converted them to.\n\nBest to ask airline specific questions in their own subreddits.

Lately, I was able to feel better about flying.\n\nEarlier this year I even had my first continental flight to India, in January, something which I had dreaded for a long time. I took Turkish Airlines (and I enjoyed it very much), but then had to change to Indigo which is a budget company, and everyone told me that it's very bad compared to Air India (ironic). The Indigo flight was kind of scary because nothing was working on the plane, like the entertainment system was permanently off, and every time we landed a couple of overhead lockers would bust open.\n\nFast forward to today, I was actually up in the air when Air India happened, on a flight from my expat country to Italy (my home country). I learned about the accident as soon as I got off. It made me feel really weird and anxious and almost zoned out for a moment - \"why them and not me\", I kept thinking.\n\nNow I have my flight back home in 2 days. I am in this rabbit hole of reading statistics again, trying to wrap my head around the accident. I keep getting headlines on social media from pilots saying this incident was \"bound to happen\" because of Boeing's bad safety record.

    "text": "After the Air India crash, we were wondering: what are the most brutal ones in history?\n\n# 1. Deadliest accident in aviation history\n\n# Pan Am Flight 1736 and KLM Flight 4805\n\nLocation: Tenerife, Canary Islands\n\nDate of Incident: 27-Mar-77\n\nTotal Fatality: 583\n\nOn March 27, 1977, two Boeing 747 passenger jets collided on the runway at Los Rodeos Airport (now Tenerife North Airport), on the Spanish island of Tenerife, Canary Islands. The crash killed 583 people, making it the deadliest accident in aviation history. As a result of the complex interaction of organizational influences, environmental conditions, and unsafe acts leading up to this aircraft mishap, the disaster at Tenerife has served as a textbook example for reviewing the processes and frameworks used in aviation mishap investigations and accident prevention.\n\n[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenerife_airport_disaster)\n\n# 2. Worst domestic flight accident\n\n# Japan Airlines Flight 123\n\nLocation: Ueno, Japan\n\nDate of Incident: 12-Aug-85\n\nTotal Fatality: 520\n\nJapan Airlines Flight was a scheduled domestic Japan Airlines passenger flight from Tokyo's Haneda Airport to Osaka International Airport, Japan. On Monday, August 12, 1985, a Boeing 747SR operating this route suffered an explosive decompression 12 minutes into the flight and, 32 minutes later, crashed into two ridges of Mount Takamagahara in Ueno, Gunma Prefecture, 100 kilometers (62 miles) from Tokyo. The crash site was on Osutaka Ridge, near Mount Osutaka.\n\n[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Airlines_Flight_123)\n\n# 3. The world's deadliest mid-air collision\n\n# Saudi Arabian Flight 763 and Kazakhstan Airlines Flight 1907\n\nLocation: Charkhi Dadri, India\n\nDate of Incident: 12-Nov-96\n\nTotal Fatality: 349\n\nThe Charkhi Dadri mid-air collision occurred on 12 November 1996 over the village of Charkhi Dadri, to the west of New Delhi, India. The aircraft involved were a Saudi Arabian Airlines Boeing 747-100B en route from Delhi to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, and a Kazakhstan Airlines Ilyushin Il-76 en route from Chimkent, Kazakhstan, to Delhi. The crash killed all 349 people on board both planes, making it the world's deadliest mid-air collision, the deadliest aviation accident to occur in India, and the third-deadliest aircraft accident in the history of aviation.\n\n[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charkhi_Dadri_mid-air_collision)\n\n# 4. Fatal accident due to aircraft design flaw\n\n# Turkish Airlines Flight 981\n\nLocation: Fontaine-Chaalis, France\n\nDate of Incident: 03-Mar-74\n\nTotal Fatality: 346\n\nTurkish Airlines Flight 981 was a regularly scheduled flight from Istanbul Yesilköy Airport to London Heathrow Airport with an intermediate stop in Paris at Orly Airport. On 3 March 1974 the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 operating the flight crashed into the Ermenonville forest outside Paris, killing all 346 people on board. At the time, it was the deadliest plane crash in aviation history. It still remains the fourth-deadliest plane crash in aviation history, the second deadliest with no survivors, and the deadliest single-plane crash with no survivors, and the second worst aviation accident in Europe.\n\n[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Airlines_Flight_981)\n\n# 5. The first bombing in aviation history\n\n# Air India Flight 182\n\nLocation: Atlantic Ocean\n\nDate of Incident: 23-Jun-85\n\nTotal Fatality: 329\n\nAir India Flight 182 was an Air India flight operating on the Vancouver–Toronto–Montreal–London–Delhi route. On 23 June 1985, the Boeing 747-237B serving the flight (c/n 21473/330, registration VT-EFO, 'Emperor Kanishka') was destroyed by a bomb at an altitude of 31,000 feet (9,400 m). It crashed into the Atlantic Ocean while in Irish airspace. It was the first bombing of a 747 jumbo jet. A total of 329 people were killed, including 268 Canadian citizens, 27 British citizens and 24 Indian citizens. The incident was the largest mass murder in Canadian history. It was the deadliest terrorist attack involving an airplane until the September 11, 2001, attacks. It is also the deadliest aircraft bombing. The bombing of Air India 182 occurred at the same time as the Narita Airport bombing. Investigators believe that the two plots were linked, and that those responsible were aiming for a double bombing. However, the bomb at Narita exploded before it could be loaded onto the plane.\n\n[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182)\n\n# 6. The deadliest aviation disaster that did not involve a crash on impact or mid-flight break-up\n\n# Saudia Flight 163\n\nLocation: Riyadh, Saudi Arabia\n\nDate of Incident: 19-Aug-80\n\nTotal Fatality: 301\n\nSaudia Flight 163 was a scheduled Saudia passenger flight which caught fire after takeoff from Riyadh International Airport (now the Riyadh Air Base) en route to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on 19 August 1980. All 287 passengers and 14 crew on board the Lockheed L-1011-200 TriStar (registration HZ-AHK) died from smoke inhalation after the aircraft made a successful emergency landing at Riyadh. At the time, the accident was the second-deadliest single-aircraft disaster in history, after Turkish Airlines Flight 981. It is the sixth-deadliest aircraft disaster overall.\n\n[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudia_Flight_163)\n\n# 7. The most fatal airliner shootdown\n\n# Malaysia Airlines Flight 17\n\nLocation: Near Hrabove, Donetsk Oblast\n\nDate of Incident: 17-Jul-14\n\nTotal Fatality: 298\n\nMalaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17/MAS17) was a scheduled passenger flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur that was shot down on 17 July 2014 while flying over eastern Ukraine, killing all 283 passengers and 15 crew on board. Contact with the aircraft, a Boeing 777-200ER, was lost about 50 km (31 mi) from the Ukraine–Russia border and wreckage of the aircraft landed near Torez in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, 40 km (25 mi) from the border. The crash occurred in an area controlled by the Donbass People's Militia during the Battle in Shakhtarsk Raion, part of the ongoing war in Donbass. The crash is the deadliest airliner shootdown, and was Malaysia Airlines' second aircraft loss during 2014 after Flight 370 on March 8.",

I have never traveled outside of my country before, so I have no experience with international trips.\n\nI am currently unsure about which luggage brand would be best, considering factors such as weight, durability, security, and any other aspects I may not be aware of. I have been considering President's luggage so far. Do you have any pros and cons to share?\n\nAdditionally, I am confused about how many pieces of luggage and what sizes (20\", 24\", 26\", and 28\") I should take with me. According to the flight information for my desired date, I am allowed a maximum of 40 kg. Should I buy two pieces of luggage, and if so, what sizes would be best?\n\nLastly, I have one more question: I am allowed an extra 7 kg for overhead carry-on. If I carry my laptop, mobile phone, and important documents in my backpack, will their weights count toward the 7 kg limit? Or is this limit separate from a smaller piece of luggage, such as a 20\" bag?\n\n  \nThanks in advance.",

The itinerary was Sept 26 2025  Sydney to Istanbul to Athens, returning on the same route on Oct 13th 2025.\n\n**March 2025**\n\n* **Early March:** I called Turkish Airlines customer service to inquire about changing the outbound leg's destination from Athens to Antalya. I was informed that this change would be possible and free of charge.\n* **Mid-March:** Based on the information provided by Turkish Airlines, my extended family in the UK booked their travel to Turkey.\n* **Late March:** A few days after the initial call, I contacted Turkish Airlines again to proceed with the change. This time, a charge of AUD 2,884 was quoted for the itinerary modification. Despite expressing dissatisfaction regarding the incorrect information previously provided, I paid the fee for the change and received an email invoice receipt from the airline showing the flights Sydney to Istanbul to Antalya and returning Athens to Istanbul to Sydney.\n\n**June 2025**\n\n* **June 2nd:** While checking flight times via the \"Manage booking\" section on the Turkish Airlines website, I noticed that the return leg from Athens to Istanbul was missing from the booking.\n* **June 2nd (Same Day):** I immediately called the Turkish Airlines customer relations number and was advised to submit an online feedback form, which I did.\n* **June 2nd (Same Day):** I visited the Turkish Airlines sales office in Sydney. The staff were polite and helpful but stated they could not resolve the issue or explain why a segment of the return journey had been removed. They also advised me to use the online feedback form and assured me they would flag the feedback number to ensure a response.\n* **June 9th:** Despite the automated response from the online feedback form stating a reply would be provided within 7 days, I had not received any communication. I called the customer relations number again, and after explaining the entire case from the beginning, the agent expressed their apologies but reiterated the need to submit feedback online.\n* **June 11th:** I called Turkish Airlines customer relations again and updated the log on the feedback form, inquiring why I hadn't received any update. After another tortuous explanation of the entire case, I was again told there wasn't anything the agent could do, but I could definitely expect a call back within a \"few hours.\"\n\n**June 13th:** Still waiting for the promised call back, I called yet again. The first 15 minutes of the call were spent trying to get an agent to understand my accent and locate my email, highlighting the lack of proficient English speakers which makes these calls exponentially more challenging. After explaining the situation YET AGAIN, I was once more told that someone would look into the case and respond to me soon. Apparently, there is no other escalation path with Turkish Airlines, and as it stands, I still have no flight from Athens to Istanbul for myself or my sons—something I suspect I would only have found out at the check-in desk in Athens airport!",

When I was doing research, I found very limited information about the process—so I hope this helps someone who’s planning to do the same!\n\nReina was just 5 months old when we made the trip. We flew with Turkish Airlines:\n\n* Tbilisi to Istanbul: 2h 35min\n* Istanbul to Vancouver: 12h 15min\n\nWe reserved Reina’s space on the flight ahead of time. Turkish Airlines requires you to make pet reservations **i**n person or by phone, as it can’t be done online. A friend of mine visited the Turkish Airlines office in Tbilisi and added Reina to my ticket. I paid for her fare the day before departure, $560 USD. \n\nWe purchased a basic crate that allowed her to stand up comfortably. I attached a water bottle to the crate door, added pee pads, her favorite toy, a blanket she loved, my shirt, and an AirTag for peace of mind. (No food—we were told dogs don’t usually eat when they’re stressed.)\n\nTo bring a dog to Canada, all that was required was a valid rabies vaccine and a health certificate done within 72 hours of arrival. Check the exact process depending on your country, but in Georgia, it was straightforward.\n\nAt the airport, we checked in our luggage and weighed Reina and the crate (they must be under 25kg total per airline regulations). We passed through a special scanner and then said our very emotional goodbyes.\n\nReina was transferred during our layover in Istanbul. I tracked her using the AirTag and checked in with the flight attendants to confirm she was safely on board and that the cargo hold was climate-controlled for pets.\n\nI’ll never forget the moment I saw her crate in Vancouver—she was so happy to see us! She held it all in and didn’t have any accidents. We breezed through inspection in under 10 minutes so she could relieve herself right outside.\n\nThe journey was stressful for her, and she’s still a bit sensitive to airplane-like noises like AC units. But she’s here, safe, and living her best life—loved deeply and surrounded by people who adore her. 💛🐾",

The airline is now turning to alternative, more expensive service providers for its long-haul Boeing 777 fleet, according to the CEO Campbell Wilson.\n\nWilson confirmed the decision on Sunday, telling NDTV, “If there is a concern about continuing to do business in this fashion, then we’ll find alternatives.” He noted that the move reflects sensitivity to public sentiment in the current political context.\n\nCostlier alternatives now in use for Air India\n\nAs the Turkish Technic deal winds down, Air India is diverting its Boeing 777 maintenance needs to other providers, including Air India Engineering Services Limited (AIESL)—a government-owned enterprise—as well as facilities in Abu Dhabi and Singapore.\n\n“There is a significant additional cost,” Wilson acknowledged. “And ultimately, it does get passed on to the consumer, whether it's because there are fewer seats available to be offered and so the remaining seats have higher demand, or we just pass through the actual cost increase that we're incurring.”\n\nWilson added that some aircraft currently under maintenance will remain with Turkish Technic until their servicing is completed, while others scheduled for maintenance will be reassigned to different providers.\n\nTurkish Technic, an aircraft maintenance subsidiary of Turkish Airlines, is one of the largest providers in the region.\n\nhttps://www.turkiyetoday.com/business/air-india-ends-maintenance-deal-with-turkish-technic-at-the-cost-of-pricier-options-3202330#",

      "Your mentality is wrong. Airlines don't deliberately split people.\n\nAdjusted for inflation, flying is cheaper than ever.

My vet did not get the import permit or mention it to me (I should’ve done my research better but mistakes happen.)\n\n\nLooking for information on what to do when I’m flying out of the country in 48 hours with cats was very hard, and I even made a post on Reddit but no one commented, so I’m leaving this so the next person can have an easier time. \n\n\nThe first thing I did was immediately gather all the required documents and email them. I did have a few issues however like not having a microchip certificate but they didn’t care at the end. The health certificate I had was also only partially in English. \n\n\nIf you realize this and it’s night in Bangkok you can’t really do much. Do NOT bother with the 24/7 numbers they have for the animal quarantine number, it absolutely does not work (I tried calling on it for hours, don’t bother)\n\nTheir main number that works from 8:30-12 and then 13-15:30 one does work, but they don’t open as early as they claim, don’t even bother to try before 9:30. And you have to TRY. You might need to dial them 20 times before they pick up but they will. \n\n When I finally got in contact I told them my email and asked them to look at my application. He was saying he can’t do anything but he’ll look and I kept calling (which might be annoying, but it does work.)\n\nI stopped annoying them after a while cuz I still have a day. I ended up getting it like 5 hours after my last call to them. Not a guaranteed way but as long as they see your application they can easily do it. It doesn’t take long you just have to make sure to tell them how urgent it is and maybe annoy them a bit. \n\n\nSince I wasn’t 100% about this method working tho I was planning to get it on arrival. Many people claim it’s only for in cabin pets, but it’s not true. It’s also for accompanied cargo or checked in baggage pets (NOT NORMAL CARGO, you need one beforehand.) \n\nYou need the same documents you would need for a pre approved one. \n\nOne major thing they noted to me however was to speak with airlines beforehand and double check if I could board with my pets because some airlines will not let you board without a permit. I can at the very least tell you that Turkish airlines is good to go without a permit (from my country at least, always double check.) I was told so by their live chat, call center, and physical office I went to. \n\n",

    "title": "The AI 171 crash and why aviation safety must remain above politics",
    "text": "First and foremost, **my deepest condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in the AI171 tragedy, and to the people of Ahmedabad**. This is a heartbreaking moment for all those affected, and no discussion about policy, politics, or safety should take away from the grief and shock of this loss.\n\nGiven the tragedy that unfolded today, it is worth revisiting a broader, simmering concern.\n\nAccording to the Times Aerospace (3 June 2025), Air India had recently scaled down its cooperation with Turkish Technic, it's partner for provisioning heavy maintenance services provider for its **wide-body aircraft specifically the Boeing 777 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner**, due to escalating geopolitical tensions between New Delhi and Ankara, in the wake of the recent Indo-Pak crisis. Turkey's vocal support for Paxtan on Kashmir reportedly triggered a political meltdown and a decision by AI to reroute heavy maintenance (MRO) operations to the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and the US. Air India CEO Campbell Wilson admitted this was in response to \"**national sentiment**,\" even though India lacks sufficient domestic capacity. Meanwhile, the DGCA has ordered IndiGo to terminate its wet lease of Turkish Airlines B777s by 31 August, and Turkish ground handler Celebi has had its security clearance revoked on national security grounds.\n\nTimes Aerospace: [Air India moves to sever MRO links with Turkiye](https://www.timesaerospace.aero/news/maintenance/air-india-moves-to-sever-mro-links-with-turkiye) (3 June 2025)  \nTimes of India: [Air India to shift maintenance work from Turkish firm as it 'looks to adjust plans' amid geopolitical tensions](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/air-india-to-shift-maintenance-work-from-turkish-firm-as-it-looks-to-adjust-plans-amid-geopolitical-tensions/articleshow/121552159.cms) (1 June 2025)\n\n>Addressing questions regarding Air India’s ongoing use of Turkish Technic for wide-body aircraft maintenance, Wilson pointed to the global nature of aviation supply chains but underlined the airline’s responsiveness to geopolitical shifts and public sentiment. \"It does take a while to adjust when the circumstances change around us **but we are obviously sensitive to the national sentiment and perhaps the national wishes**. So, regardless of which country we are talking about, we would clearly take cognisance of what people like us to do and expect us to do,\" Wilson said in an interview with PTI.\n\nI want to make it clear: I am not implying that this crash was caused by this recent MRO transition. Aircraft systems do not deteriorate that rapidly. However, it is absolutely critical to recognise what's at stake when geopolitical symbolism trumps commercial and engineering logic.\n\nMRO, which stands for Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul, is not a luxury. It is the backbone of aviation safety. It involves routine inspections, major overhauls, part replacements, everything that keeps planes airworthy and safe. Turkish Technic is widely recognised as world-class in this domain. To disrupt such a tie not because of technical or commercial issues, but because of political pressure amidst diplomatic muscle-flexing, is deeply worrying. (While Air India likely maintains a diverse portfolio of MRO service providers, TT was a critical one, entrusted with the heavy maintenance of at least some of its premier wide-body aircraft, including the Dreamliner.)\n\nThe larger issue here is how political interference, and jingoistic aspirations can force detrimental commercial and engineering decisions. AI's hand was, in essence, forced. This was an airline already grappling with significant issues, as evidenced by the articles I have shared below, detailing problems ranging from an ageing fleet to difficulties sourcing spare parts. Political interference already exacerbated an already challenging situation, adding to mounting pressures, tight schedules, and unresolved safety questions, all amidst global supply chain disruptions, chronic labour shortages, and increasing geopolitical instability.\n\nWhen jingoistic/ultranationalist sentiment is prioritised over established, globally recognised MRO expertise, especially when domestic capacity is openly acknowledged as insufficient (whither Atmanirbhar Bharat?), it creates a fundamental conflict between political objectives and the imperative of safety. The convergence of geopolitics, domestic politics, and commercial/operational stressors inevitably diminishes the overall resilience of the system. (And now who is to say what other domestic pressures Air India had been grappling with all this while?)\n\nUltimately, aviation safety must be treated as a non-negotiable imperative, one that is rigorously insulated from short-term political vacillations and fluctuations, or ultranationalist/jingoistic pressures imposed by far-right social media influencers for that matter.\n\nAl Jazeera: [Pakistan airspace ban could cost Air India $591m over 12 months: Report](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/5/1/pakistan-airspace-ban-could-cost-air-india-591m-over-12-months-report) (1 May 2025)\n\n>Air India expects to face about $600m in additional costs if a ban from Pakistan’s airspace lasts for a year and has asked the Indian government to compensate it for the hit.\n\nFinancial Express: [Air India’s transformation faces hurdles: Ageing fleet, flight delays stall Tata Group’s turnaround plans](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/airlines-aviation-air-indias-transformation-faces-hurdles-ageing-fleet-flight-delays-stall-tata-groups-turnaround-plans-3627123/) (1 October 2024)\n\n>Flight delays remain a major hurdle, with only 18% of flights to Europe and 48% to North America arriving on time in August.\n\nAirport Technology: [Air India’s fleet overhaul struggling amid supply chain pressures: The Indian flag carrier has been aiming to turnaround its profitability since it was acquired by Tata Group but has been forced to change tactics in the face of supply chain shortages](https://www.airport-technology.com/news/air-india-overhaul-struggles-supply-chain/). (27 September 2024)\n\n>CEO Campbell Wilson said Air India was “operating with one arm tied behind our back” thanks to legacy equipment on its planes.\n\nSimple Flying: [Air India Cancels 60 US Flights Due To Widebody Maintenance Delays](https://simpleflying.com/air-india-cancels-60-us-flights-due-to-widebody-maintenance-delays/) (30 October 2024)\n\n>Air India is facing delays in getting aircraft from the MRO operator it is sending to for maintenance. Then some of its wide-body planes are also grounded due to technical issues. This has resulted in the shortage of aircraft and consequently in flight cancellations.\n\nBusiness Insider: [Meet the CEO trying to turn around Air India, the 92-year-old airline with a pile of problems](https://www.businessinsider.com/air-india-ceo-turnaround-boeing-leadership-seats-supply-chain-2024-12) (16 December 2024) \\[use archive dot is to get around paywall\\]\n\n>Wilson is more concerned about delays in the supply chain, given plans to retrofit old cabins. \"It's the No. 1 frustration I have, to be quite honest,\" he said.\n\n>Two-thirds of its widebody planes haven't been updated since deliveries dating back to 2007. For all the work on behind-the-scenes operations, Wilson says the seats are \"the most visible manifestation of the old Air India.\n\n>\"The gap between modern and what we offer is big, and so the urgency for us to refit these aircraft is probably greater than any other airline.\"",

It was the first time flying with them so I suspect they needed to verify our passports. \n\nWe already had assigned seats, so can’t advise on that. \n\nThe app was a bit buggy, which could have been the reason for no online check in, but I didn’t try later for the return trip.",

    "text": "TLDR: GS should be more creative in monetizing such a massive and engaged fanbase both foreign and domestic.\n\nDoesn't take a marketing wizkid to figure out how GS makes money from signings like these and why sponsors are so interested. By 10mins I think over 2.6 million people were watching and I guarantee you GS will use this going forward as an example to show how big of a reach they have, but they probably won't  need to. Companies know how valuable it is that even at 1am a player like Sane, who isn't even our biggest star, is able to draw 2.6+ million people within minutes to tune in to a shot of an airport door and 2-3 minutes of Sane leaving the airport. Based on how... lackluster the livestream was and what a frenzied free for all it became its sadly obvious this was not very organized from a marketing/financial standpoint.\n\nGS needs to figure out a way to monetize these kinds of fan interactions. Have a few sponsor's ads and a podium outside the entrance or just have the whole thing sponsored by one company and have them slap their logo on the barricades.. or have it as a banner on the livestream. It won't ruin the experience at all and having a sponsor involved will most likely elevate the production level like having smart guys greet them who can properly teach the uclu. Its 2025 and our club just had this enormous response to ANOTHER star's arrival and we made no money from it besides youtube pennies. People will talk about and share this arrival for the next few days and as we have seen with other players these images get replayed for years. Turkish Airlines or Turkcell or whoever wouldn't love to have sponsored those events and have their logo somewhere in the back? This is not some holy event that should only have GS colors and flags.. this isn't about 'selling out' bc theres a huge PEPSI mascot jumping next to Sane.. it will change nothing, the events already have been a wild mess and the players won't care one iota nor will the fans who go to the airport.\n\nWe should be more creative in finding ways to make money when we hold such a valuable asset: an engaged fanbase at home and abroad. With moments like tonight happening every summer and nonstop transfer rumors from June-August I wonder how much thought they've put into monetizing all this 'interaction' instead of watching everyone else farm interactions off us. Imagine we had a guy like Erden Timur still...how many people would tune in to a sponsored livestream of him clarifying transfer rumors and announcing targets or revealing done deals with players? A lot. Hell, make a Galatasaray late night talk show and bring the players on even THAT stupid idea would probably make millions. The fanbase is starving for engagement and are more curious than ever about the players.",

      "I get what you are saying I'm pretty sure everyone on here was surprised by the turnout both online and at the airport. How big of a soccer fan are you? I would say 90%+ of the worldwide footballing community would have considered Sane a world class player about 500 days ago. The past two seasons I really have not been keeping tabs on the guy but seems like he had pretty solid seasons ..this season he played 1700 minutes and scored 11 goals and won the bundesliga. Double digit goals and assists for Bayern the past 5 seasons except 2025 he only had 5 assists. \n\nHes 29 and the way our locker room is right now and our hyped fanbase I think he will be happy and wont have these rumored attitude problems.. so optimistically we believe we signed that world class player from 3 seasons ago who can dunk on super lig teams but also has the composure and technique to deliver in the UCL"

My confirmed booking in seat 1K clearly proves the original flight was intended to be on an A330. \n\nThis wasn’t just a minor inconvenience—the food quality was nowhere near the standard we’ve enjoyed on their wide-body planes. To make matters worse, the cabin crew seemed completely disengaged, inattentive, and shockingly ran out of water midway through our flight. When I raised this issue through their online complaint form, Turkish Airlines dismissed my concerns by claiming the flight was always scheduled as a 737 and abruptly closed the case, ignoring clear evidence I provided of my original booking. This experience fell significantly short of the luxury and comfort Turkish Airlines promises for its premium passengers, especially disappointing given the significance of this trip. Extremely dissatisfied and let down.",

So B737 is essentially an upgrade from A330-200. Also they fly B737 during weekdays, and bring higher capacity aircraft during busy weekend days. \nAlso aircraft change happens regularly, it’s often dependent on sector load and aircraft availablity. I could imagine that TK must be putting most of their available aircraft’s to Saudi Arabia these days in order to fly all the pilgrims out of the country.",

I encountered the same thing where our flight was delayed in Istanbul for close to 2 hours and then cramped in a smaller plane that we expected ; I counted 27 rows each with 6 people so total people on the plane was around 160. To make matters worse they left everyone’s luggage and didn’t even announce it and we found out all this when we arrived in Nairobi at 0300. \nMy hunch is that they have an A330 on the route but some day they are not getting enough people on the route and to save money they cramp people into smaller jets.

I was instructed by a representative to gather the necessary documents, which included:\n• Ticket or reservation number\n• Breed and weight of each dog (including the cage)\n• Rabies vaccination certificate\n• Proof of microchip\n• CDC import receipt\n \nI was then advised to submit this information via the feedback system, and was assured there was plenty of time to add our pets to the reservation before July 4, 2025. On May 16, 2025, I submitted all the required documents to the feedback department. Then on May 18, 2025, I received a response requesting proof of a “CDC-registered animal care facility” in the USA. I contacted CDC personnel in Los Angeles, who confirmed that Romania is not a high-risk rabies country and therefore this requirement does not apply to us. I relayed this accurate information back to the Turkish Airlines feedback department. To ensure nothing was missed, I resubmitted all original documents on May 21, 2025. By May 24, 2025, I logged in to the feedback portal and saw the status marked as “Completed.” I then contacted Turkish Airlines to confirm the pets were added. I was told they were, but to call back later for final confirmation. After following up, I was informed the addition was still “pending.” On June 9, 2025, I called again, only to be told it was now too late to add our pets due to a “restriction” and that I would need to change our flights—at our own expense. This is deeply frustrating and unacceptable. The delays and misinformation came entirely from your side. We provided all correct and complete documentation well in advance. The response from Turkish Airlines was both delayed and inaccurate, and it has now jeopardized our travel plans.

    "text": "I booked a long-haul flight with Turkish Airlines expecting reliable service for the premium price I paid. Instead, I received poor support and discovered critical gaps only after booking. No meal available for my medically necessary vegan + gluten-free diet, even on a long flight. Their customer service was nearly unreachable (20+ minute wait, unhelpful bot), and they provided no clear answers about the transfer process in Istanbul — important for anyone flying with pets or needing transit info.\n\nTheir in-cabin pet policy is also inhumane: the approved carrier size doesn’t allow food or water dispensers for long flights. For a premium airline, it’s unacceptable they charge so much yet fail to fulfill basic services or respond responsibly. I’ve opened a PayPal dispute and requested a refund due to misrepresentation and the lack of humane treatment. I hope they take responsibility and improve.",

    "text": "Happy Monday! Covid-19 remains mostly quiet (for now), but measles, ticks, and wildfire smoke are ramping up quickly. At the same time, falsehoods are clouding the facts on abortion care and infant formula. Calling this information landscape “confusing” doesn’t quite do it justice.\n\nLet’s break it down.\n\n\n**First, good news! A new class of antibiotics is here.**\n\nFor the first time in nearly 30 years, the FDA has approved a brand-new class of antibiotics to treat urinary tract infections—a breakthrough in the fight against antibiotic resistance. The new drug, Blujepa, works differently than older antibiotics like penicillin or nitrofurantoin, which target cell walls or protein production. Instead, it blocks two enzymes E. coli needs to replicate.\n\nMore than 2.8 million antimicrobial-resistant infections occur in the U.S. each year, so this new class is promising because bacteria haven’t built up resistance to it. In clinical trials, it cleared infections in up to 58% of cases, slightly outperforming the standard drug (44%). It’s also safe, with mild but some uncomfortable side effects, including diarrhea (16%) and nausea (9%).\n\nIt’s expected to be available by the end of the year, though the price hasn’t been disclosed yet. The research was partially funded by BARDA, the federal agency that supports medical countermeasures for public health threats.\n\n**Latest disease trends**\n\nCovid-19 is still quiet overall.\nEmergency room visits for Covid-19 are starting to tick up in Hawaii and, if you squint, in places like Florida. YLE has also heard more anecdotal reports lately (sometimes an early signal of a wave), but wastewater levels remain low across most of the country.\n\nThat said, the U.S. has had a summer wave every year for the past five years, and other countries are seeing upticks, so we still think one is coming. A newer variant, NB.1.1, was recently detected. Time will tell if it has enough “oomph” to create a wave.\n\nThose over age 65 are still eligible for a Covid-19 vaccine every 6 months. Sticking to that schedule is still a good idea.\n\n**Measles cases continue to pop up.**\n\nThe outbreaks in Montana (19 cases and two hospitalizations) and North Dakota (34 total cases and two hospitalizations) continue to grow. Almost all cases are unvaccinated, school-aged children.\n\nWith an uptick in travel during summer, more measles cases will come. In Colorado, an infected person on a Turkish Airlines flight is now linked to 7 cases, all in unvaccinated individuals. Four people were passengers on the May 13 flight, and three were infected at the airport. The incubation period for that flight is now over, so hopefully we don’t see many more cases.\n\nThe Southwest outbreak has dramatically slowed down, with fewer and fewer cases in Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico. Below is a “bell-shaped curve” showing the deceleration nicely. Measles is likely running out of infection pathways (due to vaccination efforts or people getting infected.)\n\nThe U.S. is on track (1,173 cases today) to exceed its 30-year high for measles cases (1,274) within two to three weeks.\n\n**It's the dead middle of tick season.**\n\nEmergency visits for tick bites have reached 107 per 100,000 weekly, but trends are coming down, hopefully for the year.\n\nNot every tick you encounter will give you a disease (depends on several factors), but the highest risk of Lyme disease is in the Northeast and Midwest. To protect against ticks, cover up with light clothing, use an EPA-registered insect repellent, and remember to do a tick check.\n\nKeep reading: [Link](https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/covid-still-quiet-measles-ticks-smoke) ",

I fly there about once a year and want to optimize award redemptions.\n\nCurrently I’m pretty happy with AMEX. I’m using the Gold + Blue Business Plus + Rakuten combo and earning points is easy. But booking flights to Turkey has been tricky: • AMEX doesn’t seem to have Turkish Airlines availability through their travel portal. • I’ve mostly found Air Canada redemptions via Aeroplan: ~90,000 points for business, 55,000 for economy. Economy feels like ~1 cpp value. • Transferring MR points to Air Canada works, but options feel limited.\n\nI’ve also got a Capital One card and I’m considering leaning more into that ecosystem. They seem to show more availability — both Turkish Airlines and Air Canada — and I could always use the purchase eraser when redemption values aren’t great.\n\nSo here’s my dilemma: • AMEX: Easy to earn, but limited access to Turkish flights and not always great redemption value. • Capital One: Better availability and flexibility, but slower point accumulation for me.\n\nWould love to hear from folks who regularly book award flights to Turkey (especially from LAX).

      "I assume you are doing laundry during the trip. Can you do some sink laundry and cut underwear from 16 pairs down to 5-7? Your packing cubes do look heavy, could you transfer some items into ziplocks? Maybe try some dry toiletries? \n\nI agree with the other comment - you have a 2.8kg bag for a trip with 7kg limit. And you still have more liquids with bottles and electronics to pack. And there is overlap in how many tops and dresses you have. Look at exactly how many outfits you can create (will you actually wear them, what scenarios) and plan some cuts based on laundry timing, just-in-case items and single use items.\n\nFor the plane, I find Uniqlo extra stretch joggers are really versatile, and light (mediumpair is 215g), maybe you already own something similar? Just choose something comfortable.",

      "From your bag I am assuming that you're a fellow Australian. I bought a kids size Tesalate towel and it has been really useful for me on trips. I have used it as bath towel, beach towel, blanket on plane, picnic blanket, sarong and shawl for church/mosque cover up. It dries much faster than a Turkish towel.",
      "For your fringe - could you wet it and blow dry it down for styling? Most places should have a hairdryer accessible (even a handryer if in a pinch!). Alternatively you could use a lightweight Velcro roller as an option. \nAlso your bag is kinda heavy, if you have an option to use something lighter it could help you out. Ie Kathmandu feather light is a rolling bag at 1.6kg or an Osprey Fairview 40l is at 1.4kg iirc. I would also pack less undies and you can hand wash if needed in your sink. \nWeigh your shoes too and wear your heaviest pair on the plane. You could also put some things in your pockets as well that are heavier to make it through. \nI would also recommend taking more sunscreen, I was surprised how much more expensive sunscreen is in Europe and the quality isn’t as good imo as back home (have assumed your aussie based on the brands of items youve got).",
      "Questions. \n\n- Whats the weight of your empty bag?\n- You mostly have dresses and one pair of shorts. So why so many tops? This is where I would make cuts … edit - two skirts, and shorts. \n- Still, I’d cut at least 1/3 of anything you have multiples of and see how many outfit combos you have left - I’d cut dresses if it were me. Less versatile. \n- I assume the scarf and dress lengths are to account for the need to cover up for some sightseeing?"

My wife had no issues with the airline in Istanbul - she presented her passport, expired green card, and the original extension letter.  Airline staff seemed to be familiar with the extension letter, and the process was smooth. We had no issues at U.S. passport control either - the officer just asked how long we were gone for and the reason for travel.

Are there any complimentary services or snacks offered during layovers?\n\n2. What’s the layover process like for international connections?\n\n3. Anything to be mindful of or avoid while at IST?\n\nAny general tips to make the layover smoother or more enjoyable?\n\nAppreciate any advice – thanks!\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Short connection, missed flight, banality of evil of the Turkish Airline staff.",
    "text": "I had a flight from DXB to IAD with a very short connection of about an hour at IST. Unfortunately, this was the best flight I could get at the very last minute, but I didn’t know I had to go through such an ordeal. I got off the plane, ran towards the gate the earliest I could find gate information, and had to go through a large part of the airport, including security checking at some point, and ran across the whole gate hall for D Gates to reach Gate D14, only to find out that I missed the gate closing by 2 minutes. \n\nFacts: I reached the gate at 15:22 and the plane was taking off at 15:40 local time. We had landed at about 14:50 local time with what should have been a 25 min delay or so. I flagged this as a concern already to the flight attendant while on the plane from DXB to IST, but she mentioned the flight was not delayed and looked chill. I was under the naive impression that if I was not able to make the flight, there would be ground staff to help me, but there was absolutely none at all, and I had to navigate through the entire airport on my own. \n\nThe plane was still docking by the gate when I arrived, but the airport security insisted they were unable to open the gate. Apparently, this happens a couple of times every day, but the security staff do not have the access to open the gate; they insist their only job is to check passports and could not help us. When I tried to take a video of the plane and the gate to leave evidence, one of the staff threatened to call the police on me, and I had to berate him for his terrible attitude. There were at least 5 others like me, and they were all redirected to the care point for the next flight. \n\nMy next flight was >12 hours away, and I had to cancel my plans to visit Washington DC entirely, opting to fly directly to Chicago. The person at the care point did an absolutely terrible job explaining the flight times that he could put me on, confusing between AM and PM despite me trying to clarify multiple times. I am entitled to the hotel booked by Turkish Airlines, but the hotel service desk was all the way outside of the passport control, and due to my flight at 6:30 AM, I essentially had to be on the shuttle back to the airport 3 hours before the boarding time, about 2:30 AM. I tried to get them to write down the instructions (I.e. how to get to the service desk, what I’m entitled to), but they mentioned they can only inform this verbally and not on paper. \n\nWith what I read on Reddit about potential disputes at the desk I felt like it was a risk to head out to the desk beyond passport control only to be told my entitlements were otherwise, but based on the description there was some chance that my experience would have been what was shared here in the video - being shuttled to a hotel 50min away from the city, have some hotel meals covered, and shuttled back in about 8 hours or so.  \n\nhttps://youtu.be/QoNQW72fVyksi=7cydkYAMrsv-9-Hk\n\nBased on whatever I experienced so far, I just decided the risk was not worth taking and decided to stay a couple of hours at the airport hotel Yotel instead with my own funds. \n\nInstead of the hotel compensation, I asked to be given meal vouchers, which I could only collect once every 5 hours. I had to return to the same care point every 5 hours, and the options were only fast food, being joints like Subway, Carl’s Jr, Popeyes, etc., at the food court. It seemed like this happens a lot because they specifically have the passenger voucher meal that catered to my exact situation. The meal was very sad too \n\nOverall, this was a terrible experience with at least 3 areas of fault by the airline: (1) knowingly arranging these short connections and closing the gate early even if they knew some passengers had not yet boarded (there were no announcements for anyone at all for any flights, and many were having last call), (2) having zero ground staff support or heads up that there is a short connection, etc., (3) arranging hotel accommodations that are so far away not near the city center, and separating the care point from the hotel service desk. You’re basically on your own when you get out there. Suffice it to say, this was one of the worst airline experiences I’ve had, and I definitely would not recommend it. ",

      "One hour is relatively short for a) anyone new arriving at Istanbul or any large airport, b) for flights departing to US as they require additional security. International flights gate are suppose to close at least 45 minutes before departure. \nOnce the gate is closed, it can only be opened if there is a declared emergency or a really higher up has to authorize it. The general staff cannot do anything about it. \n\nThe incoming may not have been delayed, but the time it takes from touchdown time to getting docked at the arrival gate could take 15-20 minutes.

If paid with an actual credit card, usually, the amount has not even been charged yet (only blocked aka pre-authorized).\nIf you paid with a debit card (one that immediately deducts funds from your bank account, hence not giving you actual credit), this may depend more on your bank than on TK. From their end, they'll still do the same as if they had charged a credit card (pre-authorization, then charge at some point usually within 24h). Your bank however counts this as a charge directly (as they don't give you actual credit).\n\nI would inquire with your bank first if funds are not returned within 48h in the second case. In the first case, it should auto-revert // you wouldn't even see it as the authorisation only lowers your credit.",

    "text": "The South Dakota Department of Health (SDDH) yesterday reported its first measles case of the year, which involves an adult resident of Meade County who became ill after international travel.\n\nIn a statement, the SDDH said the patient visited several public locations while infectious, including an urgent care in Rapid City on May 28 and an urgent care in Sturgis on May 29. \n\nWith summer travel season in full swing, states continue to report travel-linked cases, including Colorado, where at least six cases have been connected to a Turkish Airlines flight and exposure at Denver International Airport.\n\n**A few more cases linked to West Texas outbreak**\n\nMeanwhile, cases in the West Texas outbreak continue a downward trend after a peak in late March. The Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS) reported 4 more cases since its last update on May 30, raising the outbreak total to 742 cases.\n\nOver the course of the outbreak, 35 counties have reported, cases linked to the West Texas outbreak, mostly in Gaines County, where the event began. Ongoing transmission, however, is still under way in just 7 counties: Cochran, Dawson, Gaines, Lamar, Lubbock, Terry, and Yoakum.\n\nTexas, like other states, continues to report sporadic cases in other parts of the state that aren't linked to the larger outbreak. Today the TDSHS reported 1 more such case, putting the nonoutbreak total at 33 from 17 counties.\n\nThe Oklahoma State Department of Health, which has reported illnesses linked to the West Texas outbreak, today confirmed 1 more measles case, raising the state's total to 18, which include 15 confirmed and 3 listed as probable.\n\nMeanwhile, the New Mexico Department of Health reported 2 more cases, including the first form San Juan County, bringing the state’s total to 81. San Juan County is in the far northwestern corner of the state where borders Sandoval County, which now has 6 cases.\n\n**Measles sickens 2 more in Montana**\n\nThe Hill County Health Department in Montana yesterday announced that it is investigating two new measles patients, both of whom are contacts of the county's first confirmed case. Both are unvaccinated. \n\nHealth officials warned of potential exposure to the public at a local Walmart on May 23.  On the same day, the health department issued enhanced measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination recommendations for residents and travelers to Hill County owing to the potential for community transmission. It involves early accelerated vaccination for children and an additional MMR dose for adults who have received only one dose.\n\nThe Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services said the state has recorded 15 cases in three counties, Flathead, Hill, and Gallatin. Two patients were hospitalized. It added that Hill County is the only location with an enhanced vaccination recommendation.",

I live in Dubai and I dream for the day we can fly there but whenever the question of long distance flights comes up, people say the runway is not long enough. However, we recently seen all these new flights to turkey launch and even a Turkish airlines flight from Istanbul landed at the weekend. So can someone who knows this stuff, is the runway length really an issue or are airlines just not interested in flying from Cork \n\nEdit - As a follow up the below does anyone know if Turkish are planning an Istanbul route at any stage ?

    "comments": [
      "Runway length is absolutely an issue.  Dubai is a bit further away than Turkey and requires an aircraft with more endurance which means a longer runway to get to takeoff/v1 speed. \n\nThe runway length has been discussed at length before in relation to transatlantic flights.  Norweigan Airlines ran a direct Cork to Boston flight back in 2007 and one of the few aircraft at the time that could work due to the runway length was the 737 Max 8.  \n\nhttps://www.corkairport.com/news/detail/2017/09/12/europe-s-newest-aircraft-lands-at-cork-airport",
      "It is an issue, but not as big of an issue as people tend to make it out to be. It is very much possible to operate long haul flights out of Cork with relatively small payload penalties. Norwegian demonstrated it with their flights to Providence in the US, and the new flights to Izmir by SunExpress aren’t exactly short hops either. Moreover, the vast majority of Cork Airport’s market is in Europe, for which the runway is definitely sufficient.\n\nHowever, this only goes for smaller single-aisle aircraft such as the 737 or A320 series. Larger aircraft, such as the A330, A350, or Boeing 777 do have issues operating into and out of Cork, at least when they have to operate a long-haul flight. There’s just not enough runway for these aircraft to get airborne with a decent load of passengers and enough fuel for a long haul flight. And it’s not just the runway, there’s only one aircraft stand at the airport large enough to handle a 777 or A330. That stand is all the way at the northern end of the airport and it will block two smaller aircraft stands, plus likely access to a hangar, when in use. \n\nI personally don’t view the size issue as too much of an issue because I simply can’t see how Cork could generate enough traffic to make a Dubai route viable. Any transatlantic flights would likely be operated by the likes of an A320 or A321, which the airport already handles on a daily basis. The same goes for any flights to Istanbul, should they ever materialise. Having said that, it appears that the next generation of airliners that Airbus is working on, the generation to eventually replace the A320 series, will require longer runways, even for European flights. As such, the runway will eventually have to be extended. But it’s not an urgent issue and it isn’t impeding the growth of the airport.\n\nRegarding your question about whether airlines simply aren’t interested in flying from Cork, that is a very complex topic. I know people love to shout from the rooftops how “DAA is killing Cork Airport” but that’s just simply BS! The fact that Cork has managed to attract Lufthansa, Swiss/Edelweiss, Air France year-round, and now SunExpress all work as a counterpoint to that inane story. There’s money to be made operating from Cork, which is primarily what airlines care about. The big question for airlines is whether the money that can be made is enough to warrant committing an aircraft and crew, and that’s where the thorny subject of airline alliances and large multinational groups come into play. For groups such as IAG, which own Aer Lingus, British Airways and Iberia for example, Cork might simply not fit into their strategy. KLM/Air France has no such qualms and is committing aircraft from both airlines to operate from Cork, with KLM even leaving an aircraft and crew here overnight. \n\nThere’s also a capacity question. Many of the major hub airports in Europe (Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London Heathrow, Lisbon, Munich, etc.) have significant capacity constraints and/or have to deal with night-time flying restrictions to contend with. That limits the number of departures and arrivals per day and as a results, airlines will think long and hard about which destinations will give them the biggest ROI for these limited departure/arrival slots. Lisbon is a drastic example of this, being an airport that handles the same level of passengers as Dublin but only has a single runway available. I believe that this is the primary reason why there is not Cork-Lisbon flight, even though the demand is there. There’s simply no space for it at the airport, even though I’m pretty sure that TAP Air Portugal has run the numbers and come to the conclusion that it makes economic sense, and even though Star Alliance, the airline alliance that TAP is a member of, has recently expanded into Cork with Lufthansa and Swiss.",
      "Before thinking of providing more or further flights, the airport needs to be connected better to the town. Currently the only viable way to get there is by car/taxi. The busservice is the usual nightmare like everywhere in town.\nIf you add more international (or even trans continental) flights people need to be able to get from/to the trainstation and city center by other means.",
      "An Airbus A321neo could maybe just about do it. It needs 1988m to take off (Cork is 2133m) and the range is 7400km (6000km to Dubai +20% is 7200km). But it's right at the limit. Probably the greater problem is selling enough seats to make it profitable.",
      "The runway in Cork is short comparatively to most large airports, but it’s not abnormally short, in fact its longer than some airports you can go to from cork. The main issue is the location combined with its length, as frequently the airport is windy and not often is that wind directly in the runway direction and more often than not it’s from the side, this limits the performance quite a bit, especially for longer flights for takeoff (Rhodes, Izmir), and for a lot of flights when it’s stormy for landing when low visibility prevails. It is one of the only airports i’ve ever seen having extreme low visibility while also having gusting conditions, because it’s not fog, it’s just cloud you’re in, this majorly limits what you can accept as good conditions for wind with landing which is normally not a problem elsewhere. The biggest problem at the moment limiting growth in general is the lack of viable parking stands. During the summer all available parking stands close to the terminal are in use for based aircraft, and the others not in use are too small for most large aircraft. I do feel like some of the newer airbus planes could definitely do a northeast coast flight to the US or Canada, with limits on passenger numbers, but considering Shannon isn’t majorly far away, I don’t see them doing it anytime soon unless the runway is extended and allowing them to up passenger numbers to make the route profitable"

    "text": "A honest review of Turkish Airlines:\n\nBackground; we flew Los Angeles -> Turkey (layover) -> Johannesburg (South Africa)\n\nThe flight was 13 hours to Turkey and 9 hours to South Africa.\n\nInitially we chose a long layover in Turkey in hopes of exploring Istanbul for a couple of hours. Let me tell you after the first thirteen hour flight (no air conditioning, seat wouldnt lean back and not the friendliest cabin crew) we were a bit delirious when we landed in Instanbul. Personally i think a thirteen hour flight might just be too long to still have the energy to do things.  Our flight from Istanbul to South Africa was in a newer plane, so that time round we did have air conditioning and our seats did lay back which helped a lot.\n\nComing back we had the same luck, one older plane and one newer.\n\nPro’s: more affordable than other tickets we were looking at and They’re food isnt too bad.\n\nCons: Very little legroom in economy, possibility that you might have no air conditioning on a fully packed plane, cabin crew all round wasnt really friendly. They were also kind of stingy with water and drinks which felt strange and take quite long to fetch the plates after a meal.\n\nId consider this a budget airline in comparison to others ive flown internationally to South Africa such as Qatar and Delta.\n\nProbably will just spend a little extra next time.

      "Yeah no. I flew Turkish from CPT > IST > DUB and had a really not good time.\n\nThe cabin crew were super unfriendly and acted like passengers are inconveniencing them to do their jobs, the planes are uncomfortable af and the amount of amenities, while great, takes up SO MUCH of the limited legroom you have. The in-flight entertainment is pretty good and the food is okay but I really didn't have a great time with them and won't be flying with them again unless I absolutely HAVE to."

    "text": "I went through an IndiGo Investor Presentation and found out some really fascinating data which needs to know about India’s biggest airline. They’ve basically taken over the Indian skies with a super simple but ruthless strategy. Here’s the breakdown:\n\n* **Massive Scale:** In FY25, IndiGo flew 12 crore passengers (that’s 120 million people!). Every 3 days, they fly more people than Jaipur’s entire population!\n* **Market Domination**: They’ve got a 64% domestic market share in India. Literally, every second domestic flyer in India chooses IndiGo.\n* **Huge Fleet**: They have 430+ planes and have ordered over 1,000 more – the largest order by any Indian airline ever also any airline in the \\*world.\n* **Super Frequent Flights:** One IndiGo flight takes off every 56 seconds. That’s like a bus service in the sky!\n* **No-Frills Approach**: Since starting in 2006, they skipped the fancy stuff—no free meals, no business class, no drama. Just low prices, on-time flights, and quick turnarounds (20 minutes, best in the biz!).\n* **Smart Strategy**: While airlines like Kingfisher chased luxury and crashed, IndiGo focused on being “boring” but brilliant—low costs, high efficiency, and scale.\n* **Global Ambitions:** They’re now going international—flying to 35+ destinations, partnering with Turkish Airlines\\*, and targeting Gulf, Southeast Asia, and Europe. They’re even adding wide-body planes to compete with giants like Emirates and Qatar Airways!\n* **Cargo Game**: IndiGo’s Cargo logistics arm is a hidden gem, moving everything from vaccines to e-commerce goods. With e-commerce booming, this could be huge.\n* **Why They Win:** No promoter drama, professional management, and some of the lowest costs per seat globally. They’re also the most profitable airline in Asia right now.\n* **Fun Fact:** They flew more passengers in 2025 than Japan’s entire population (around 125 million)!\n\nIndiGo’s basically turned flying into an affordable, no-nonsense experience for millions of Indians, and now they’re aiming to dominate globally. What do you think about their strategy? Would love to hear your thoughts! \n\n\n\n",

    "text": "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in its weekly update today reported 42 measles cases, some tied to a large outbreak centered in West Texas and others linked to instances of community transmission or travel to other states or countries, lifting the nation's total to 1,088 infections.\n\nTwo more states reported their first cases this week, Iowa and Nebraska, putting the number of affected jurisdictions at 33. The number of outbreaks remained at 14, and 90% of cases are linked to outbreaks.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of patients (96%) are unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status, and affected patients are roughly evenly split between kids younger than 5 years old, school-age children, and adults ages 20 and older.\n\nIn a related development, the CDC this week updated its measles travel advisory, noting that measles cases are rising in many countries and that all international travelers should be fully vaccinated with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, including an early dose for infants ages 6 to 11 months old.\n\n**West Texas total grows by 9**\n\nThe Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS) today reported 9 more cases in the West Texas outbreak, putting the total since January at 738. Though 35 counties have reported cases linked to the outbreak, only 7 still have ongoing transmission. \n\nLike other states, Texas also continues to record measles cases from various sources that apparently aren't linked to the larger outbreak, and today officials reported 8 more such infections, lifting that total to 32. \n\nA few other states have reported cases linked to West Texas activity, but no new illnesses were reported in New Mexico or Oklahoma. On May 28, Kansas reported a total of 64 cases from 11 counties, 59 of them linked to an outbreak in the southwestern part of the state.\n\n**Colorado cluster tied to Turkish Airlines flight**\n\nElsewhere, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) said yesterday that it and partners in Arapahoe County have now confirmed three measles cases in people who were on the same Turkish Airlines flight that arrived in Denver on May 13. The latest patient is a vaccinated Arapahoe County adult, and the two earlier announced cases involved an out-of-state traveler who was infectious on the flight and an Arapahoe County child who was likely exposed on the flight. \n\nMeasles is highly infectious and can remain in the air for up to 2 hours after an infected person leaves the area.\n\nMontana health officials reported a second measles case in Flathead County, a person who had traveled outside the state. Also, the health department in Gallatin County has now reported 2 community cases, beyond an earlier family cluster, putting the total at 10.\n\nIn Michigan, the Marquette County Health Department, located in the Upper Peninsula, reported a case in a local resident, noting that it was working closely with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to investigate the case.

Each of us had a 30kg allowance, so altogether we had 90kg. We brought four bags, each weighing around 20kg, so the total was just 80kg — which should’ve been fine based on my past experience.\n\nBut when we tried to check in, only three of the bags were accepted. That left each of us with 10kg of unused allowance, but we couldn’t check in the fourth bag because no one had enough allowance left INDIVIDUALLY to cover it. Even though we were still under the 90kg total, they didn’t let us combine it.\n\nIt really caught me off guard. I’m sharing this because I’d like to know — is this normal for Turkish Airlines?

Both can't be true- we offer 30kg ticket which means you can check in as many bags as you want, totalling 30kg. OR 2PC allowence, which means the bags strictly can't be over 23kg each. \n\nIf its the 30kg allowence, then under the same PNR we can share the weights and bags between everyone so it doesn't matter how much everyone has, it's ok as long as total weigh is under.\n\nFor 2PC technically we can pool the bags but a single bag still can't be over 23kgs, even if someone has allowence left. It sounds like this was the case for you. \n\nI have people that need to sort their baggage everyday because of the 2pc allowence, they maybe have one bag at 26kg and one at 21kg. Even though the total weight is under 46kg, we strictly have to have a single bag under 23kg. :O",

      "If the airline sells it, there MUST be enough time for that. Airlines have lots of expenses for passengers who miss their flight, so they have no reason to sell tickets which are not possible...\n\nAnd the guaranteed connection in IST is 1 hour to 1 hr 15 min, depending on particular flights. So you are likely to be bored for about 2 hours (unless there is a delay).\n\nYes you can head to the city but it's far and it will be night, so I don't think it's a good idea.",
      "Short answer : that’s plenty of time. \nLong answer: Even anything under 75 minutes is doable as long as one is aware of the airport and knows what to do. or the first flight is not delayed. \n\nFor the return flight , you will likely get a meal voucher that can be used at certain restaurants for specific meals. You can get the voucher either through the app or through the support desk.\n\nLastly, try to download the IST airport app to get yourself acquainted. The WiFi/internet access is free now at the airport so connectivity is not a problem. You can find some quiet spots for a nap etc.  Pack some snacks etc as the food is extremely expensive at the airport.",
      "3 Hours is plenty of time to get through security, grab a bite to eat (Cheaper fast food spots are upstairs, more expensive cafes and restaurants are downstairs) and stretch your legs for bit until the next flight.\n\nAs for the 7 hour layover there are plenty of shops to browse through to kill some time.  \nThere is a hotel airside you can rent for 4 hour but pretty expensive.  There a sleep pods you can rent by the hour or reclined napping chairs in multiple spots for free.",
      "Was there Saturday for similar situation. That’s lots of time.\n\nBeware that some flights come in without jet bridges, so there is time to take the bus to the terminal, the transit security is pretty fast, but gates are pretty spread out. You’ll get your steps in for sure!",

Since we’re flying economy, we only get 2 free nights, so I’ll need to pay for the 3rd night.\n\nWhen creating the hotel voucher on the Turkish Airlines website, I noticed that there were multiple options for check-in dates and room selections—probably because we are 2 adults and 2 kids.\n\n**Here’s my question:**  \nCan I create **two separate vouchers** with different check-in dates? For example:\n\n* I create a voucher for myself and one child for the day we arrive.\n* My spouse creates a voucher for themselves and the other child, with a check-in date for the next day.\n\nThe idea is that once the first voucher’s two free nights are over, we could check out and then check in using the second voucher—basically avoiding having to pay for the third night.\n\nWould this work, or would there be issues/confusion with the hotel or Turkish Airlines?",

      "I think you’d  possibly have problems with room occupancy with the hotel. That’s the first thing that pops into my head, because European hotel rooms tend to be small. And they also don’t tend to have multiple entrances so I feel like they’d notice if you were registered as two but showed up as 4.\n\nYou’d also possibly have to book separately which means your tickets wouldn’t be tied together. If it was on a single reservation/credit card, I don’t think you’d be able to book multiple vouchers.\n\nI don’t know. Instanbul hotels don’t seem that expensive so it seems like it would higher risk for lower payoff. ",

    "title": "ANA RTW Booking (just providing a data point for everyone)",
    "text": "Hi y'all!\n\nJust wanted to post a data point for an ANA RTW booking I made a few days ago that is relatively close-in (July 11-26), so it is possible to do something in the short term. It's difficult no doubt, but not impossible.   Also just wanted to include some observations that might be helpful.\n\nItinerary:\n\n* LAX-ICN in OZ J (4 nights in Seoul)\n* ICN-SIN in OZ Y (3 nights in Singapore)\n* SIN-BKK in SQ J\n* BKK-IST in TG J (5 nights in Istanbul/Cappadocia)\n* IST-NAP in TK J\n* NAP-EWR in UA J\n\nTotal Cost: 115k miles + $962 fees/surcharges + $25 booking fee (per person)\n\nKey: \n\nY=Economy Class, J=Business Class\n\nOZ=Asiana Airlines, SQ=Singapore Airlines, TG=Thai Airways, TK=Turkish Airlines, UA=United Airlines, BR=EVA Airways\n\nYQ and YR = Carrier Imposed Surcharges \n\nNOTES:\n\n1. My original plan was to do a Southeast Asia trip, but when ANA said they were ending the RTW bookings, I decided to jump on that.  I don't have month at a time to go on trips (wife in a nurse, and I work a hybrid schedule), so we decided to cram a RTW booking into a two week window.  Still came in cheaper on points than if we just did an Asia roundtrip or Europe roundtrip, with majority of our flights in Business.  \n2. I initially tried just using United and Air Canada websites to piece together an itinerary, as well as the \"free\" version of Seats.aero.  I gave in and purchased [Seats.Aero](http://Seats.Aero) Pro and it's a legit time saver when trying to piece together an itinerary.  It was $10 well spent.  \n3. TPAC and TATL Business class availability is pretty nil within 3 month out, so if you find ANYTHING reasonable to you, use it to bookend your trip and work your way back.  It might require positioning to/from your home airport, but if your goal is to get into business cabins, it'll be worth the hassle.  I'm based out of LAX and found nothing ex-West Coast (SFO, SEA, YVR, DEN, IAH, and even ORD) in Business.  Found flights LHR-EWR and NAP-EWR (both directions - seems like people are avoiding EWR like the plague these days lol) on UA J, so used that to start building my trip.  (JFK-FRA on SQ is pretty wide open in Biz but the timing of the flight didn't really work for us, and also we wouldn't be able to tack an onward flight to LAX on UA because UA doesn't run anything there).  A few days ago, LAX-ICN in OZ J opened up -- double checked to see if NAP-EWR was still available (and it was), so I went to work knowing those two would be the bookends and then worked the rest of the trip between the two.   I used GCMAP to calculate mileage and ITA Matrix to calculate taxes. Took about an hour to piece the rest of the itinerary and then off to call ANA. \n4. Made the call about 11pm PST Monday Night 5/26/25.   End to end, call took 70 minutes, which included about 35-40min of wait time.  Once connected to an agent, took about 25-30min to feed the flights, price out the itinerary, and pay for taxes/fees.  Not all the flights you think are available actually are available to ANA (see below), so make sure you have \"backup\" flights for all the legs you want to take (in both economy and business, as often times the business class space you see is either phantom, or just isn't bookable by ANA).  \n5. Singapore long haul Business (anything that takes you beyond SE Asia (i.e. 3+ hour and 1500+ miles)) is basically not accessible by ANA, even if another airline like Air Canada shows availability.  In previous calls to ANA, I've attempted to book SIN<->PVG, HND/NRT, ICN, TPE on SQ, as Air Canada showed availability, but ANA could never book it.  But it seems SIN<->BKK, SGN, DPS or anything else within SE Asia is okay.   So if your ideal itinerary include a SQ J flight that extends beyond SE Asia, make sure you have a backup.  Air Canada showed ICN-SIN in SQ J, but ANA couldn't see it, so settled for that leg in OZ Y (with option to upgrade in future).\n6. As other people have mentioned, if you want to make any future changes to your itinerary, **you CANNOT change the airline or the routing of any of your legs**; you can ONLY change the cabin and the flight number (date/time).  In my example, for my ICN-SIN leg in OZ Y, if J class opened up for ICN-PVG-SIN on OZ/SQ J, I wouldn't be able to change it because it changes the routing.  Or, even if SQ J opened up for ICN-SIN direct, I wouldn't be able to take it because that leg is originally booked on OZ, and you can't change the carrier.  So my only hope is for OZ to open J class availability and upgrade from Y.  So basically, when you book your ANA RTW ticket, **you need to be sure about the airlines you're choosing for each segment as well as the routing, because you won't be able to change either.**  \n7. Another note about changes:  **If you make a change, they will reprice the fees for the WHOLE itinerary, not just the segment being changed.**  So if fuel surcharges for the general market goes up, you will need to pay the increases across all segments in your itinerary, not just the one being changed.  I don't know if the opposite occurs though (i.e. if fuel prices go down, do you get a refund?)\n8. If you need to connect from Asia to Europe or vice versa without having to connect in Africa or the Middle East, look on TG or BR to/from BKK.  TG/BR flies to/from a number of European (AMS, VIE, IST, etc.) cities and availability is pretty wide open.   \n9. United shows a lot of Economy Saver Awards (Class X) on United metal that isn't bookable by partners.  I would double check Air Canada first if they can see the same award availability that shows on the United Website for United Flights, before I consider using it as part of any potential itinerary.  United showed multiple Saver flights in Economy for EWR-LAX for the dates/times I needed but ANA couldn't book it.  Flying into EWR still satisfied conditions of the RTW Ticket, so just decided to leave that leg off the itinerary all together and will either buy a cash ticket or use another program to get home.   \n10. Using ITA Matrix, I calculated that my YR/YQ surcharges were going to be about $1250, so it coming it at approximately $300 less was a very pleasant surprise.  ITA Matrix showed fuel surcharges on NAP-EWR to be near $500 on its own on a cash ticket (surprising since this is on UA metal), so either 1) these fees are dramatically lower on award bookings, or 2) these fees are overstating on ITA Matrix for UA Metal because they were around the same fees ex-LHR which is notorious for their high surcharges.  \n\nI'm not currently working on another RTW booking for either Dec 2025/Jan 2026 and/or May 2026\n\nHope this helps!",

      "Hey man, I'm literally from Mississauga as well, but I went to Mount Allison University (with MFC Training). \n\nI do not regret doing a uni and flight school program at all. Yes, I could have been a commercial pilot by now but I wouldn't have had all the time to network and meet some of my closest friends, which you just can't do as easily outside of a university setting. My advice to you is GET INVOLVED. Getting involved with the aviation club at my university was the first step to being where I am now, where I've pretty much secured a pilot job right out of graduation through sheer networking. \n\nJust do it and have fun, enjoy the journey. Both schools seem good.\n\nAlso feel free to hit me up in DMs am happy to answer any questions you have, I feel like my experience is very relevant considering we're both in Canada and doing undergraduate.",
      "Honestly... I wouldn't go into university for my pilot career! For me it's a waste of time and money, because I just want to get my licenses and fly for Air Canada or maybe even Wet Jet, not sure yet haha but my goal is commercial airlines as well. You can directly go into a flight school and get your licenses rather than spending 4 years getting a degree then going to a flight school. If you want to make friends and get the uni experience and have the MONEY for it then go for it!  But me personally i'd rather become a commercial pilot sooner and get my licenses as soon as I can. If you're worried about socializing, you can always network with people at your flight school  too (Be friendly with the instructors etc.) Also side note...Im so happy for you! Right after high school I took a gap year then went into being a flight attendant so good on you for knowing what you wanna do straight out of high school. \n\n  \none final thing if you aren't sure you'll like flying id highly reccoment an introductory flight at a flight school! after I booked mine it gave me the reassurance that I wanted this fr yk?",
      "[deleted]",
      "Wow dude! This is the first time I am hearing this and you don't know how much I needed to hear this. I will be doing this for sure and you motivated me much more to lean towards a degree now. I Will take your advice and GET INVOLVED :)\n\nThank you so much for this"

      "Honestly, since you’re in Grade 12 you probably have this feeling that time is running out and you have to get everything done ASAP (every senior goes through this.) But as you get older you realize plans change and people go at their own pace. You also realize later down the road how young you were back then, and how much time you did have whilst stressing about not having enough time. \n\nTo put it in perspective for you, since you’re very passionate about aviation, you’ll have your whole life ahead of you to be flying a plane. Getting your training done two years earlier is practically nothing, especially when you’re in your twenties. If you completed your training at age 20 vs 22, how much of a difference would it make and what would it impact for you? Do you see yourself flying your entire life? If so, would starting at 20 be that drastic when you’re 30? or 40?\n\nAlso, your first two years at university fly by so so quickly. When you’re in your fourth year, you start to wonder where all the time went. \n\nThat being said, I think you should pursue what you want to, without necessarily considering “time” as your main factor. I know it’s important, but I promise you it’s a much smaller timeframe than you think, that will go by in a blink of an eye. Western does have a really good business program, and you could even enroll to see how it is and reevaluate after your first year. Or you could skip all of that altogether and do the aviation training if that’s where you really wanna go. \n\nThe only thing I’ll tell you to do is not to make a decision based on time, because it’ll pass anyway, and much sooner than you think.",
      "Not giving us much to work with here…\n\n\nYou say you’ll probably not use the school degree and just skip the university route, but you give us 2 different options for undergraduate degrees with the same amount of flight training…\n\nI do recommend western though, BMOS is a good program, and western’s student life is LEAGUES above waterloos.",
      "BMOS CAM here. \n\nSuper eh about the courses but it’s a good way to get to know the people you’ll work with in the airlines. Community here is decent and as long as you’ll put in the work you’ll be good. However, due to the program coordinator being extremely busy, you’ll get much better answers from social science academic counseling or your upper year friends.\n\nThat being said, don’t skip the university option. A lot of the airlines you have mentioned look favorably upon having degrees, even Air Canada should you stay here. \n\nFurthermore, in a messed up way, being part of the university is your ticket into the flight school. Currently, due to the enormous pressure in London by Western and Fanshawe, they’re opening a THIRD flight school. Prior to this, if you were not part of either Western or Fanshawe integrated CPL, you would’ve been asked to leave due to the sheer number of students. I can imagine this would be the same situation in Waterloo.",
      "Hey!! I just finished my first year at Western CAM and even though it’s longer than a college degree, I would definitely recommend. You make many connections through the program and learn more about the aviation industry all around through the classes. Also, it’s a nice backup to have. I see myself sticking with aviation my whole life too but if I were to get in an accident that impacts my medical, the idea of having a fallback degree is very reassuring.",
      "Go for CAM. If you just want to fly then you can do that. You also could end up being the people running the show and not just flying the plane."

I did this flight before in December 2024 with Cathay and had a pretty pleasant experience with Cathay for my first international trip. However, my first intl' trip was quite stressful because I wasn't sure what I was doing, and the layovers were relatively short of about 2 hours.  \n  \nI'm sure I could repeat this same trip and have a better experience now that I know somewhat what I'm doing, but the short flights after HKG are not business and thrown into economy seating for the same price of comparable flights and so I'm looking at alternatives.\n\nI am about 2.5 hours away from Dallas and I can either fly out of Dallas, or from another hub like I did before (flew economy to San Francisco before Business class from Cathay) and I'm trying to figure out what is the best route that is time/cost efficient & not sacrifice on the quality of the flight.\n\nFor example, I can find faster flights like San Francisco-> Singapore direct flight on United Airlines, but I don't have any experience doing 2nd round of tickets vs trying to book through 1 flight directly. I also have no experience with United for something like this on a long-haul flight on business class... flying just Singapore airlines is expensive, nearly 75% more than something like Cathay or similar.\n\nLooking at flights out of Dallas are Qatar or Turkish Airlines, and I've heard these are pretty good, but I'm not sure about the actual flight paths. They take a little longer, have longer layovers as well. For example, I'd fly out at 2pm and have an 11-hour flight, 7-hour layover, another flight to Kuala Lumpur with 2-hour layover and then 1 hour flight to Medan. \n\nAnyone have any thoughts on this and what they've done? How do you feel about a direct flight vs having a a couple short layovers?\n\nI'd love to know experience flying with Qatar vs an Asian airline like Cathay and I'd like to know about just buying a 2nd set of tickets if I choose the destination like Singapore or Kuala Lumpur. \n\nThanks so much!\n\n",

You’ll likely find that the best layover and route depends on which airline you prefer and what feels like a reasonable price.\n2. One layover is usually manageable, but two can be exhausting, especially if you have a few short flights at the end of the travel day. I’ve found that having a layover at the beginning of the trip is way easier than having two at the end when you’re already tired.\n3. One long-haul flight in business is so much better than a few smaller ones. It gives you time actually to sleep. If you want at least 6 hours of sleep, the flight should be 8+ hours long.",
      "So with that information, do you have a preference?\n\nI just have a hard time swallowing the price difference between Cathay and Singapore airlines. Almost 75% more. I can afford it, but I don't see the value in it, personally.\n\nTo me, all the planes are relatively the same. It's the food/service/lounges that change everything. They're the same Boeing 777 or A350's and there are slight differences when I look at YouTube, but not enough to warrant drastic price changes."

    "title": "First time flying Turkish Airlines: A report",
    "text": "I'm based on the U.S. West Coast. I needed to fly to France for family business and booked this flight only about a month in advance. January is low season for travel from NA to Europe, but prices were still high for a trip I hadn't budgeted. I also needed it to be an open jaw flight returning from Barcelona, where I have more family.\n\nThe best deal I could find online was Turkish Airlines. SFO > CDG and BCN > SFO turned out to be $795, seat selection included. Leaving a Tuesday.\n\nNow there is a catch with Turkish Airlines – which can also be a plus: all flights from the Americas to Europe, Asia and Africa will transit through Istanbul (IST). On the way to Paris, the connection was a couple of hours. On the way from BCN to SFO, the layover was 20 hours or so. Turkish has some deals to get a very affordable hotel room and/or a free \"tour\" of the city (which I believe lasts a couple of hours). The Touristanbul deal actually includes pickup from the airport and ride back, which in itself is a great deal. A taxi to or from the airport to downtown Istanbul (a roughly one-hour ride, depending on traffic) will cost you between 1,000 and 2,000 Turkish liras, depending on how much you get ripped off. So just that is fantastic.\n\n(Note: Next time I'll attempt using the Metro, which is very cheap, but requires at least one change if you're trying to get to the historic areas of the city where your hotel might likely be.)\n\nTurkish Airlines allows two checked-in pieces of luggage per passenger, on top of a carry-on. And trust me, most passengers will use that privilege. On the way there, I had an extra piece of luggage, but it was small enough that I kept it in the cabin. Make sure you check in online before hitting the airport. To my surprise, there was a huge line for people who didn't – maybe because they had extra luggage or children? Checking in my one piece of luggage was surprisingly fast. Whether you are connecting same day in IST or laying over for a night, your checked-in luggage will not need to get picked up there, and will be sent along with your flights to the final destination.\n\nBooking using the Turkish Airlines website is best. The app is a bit buggy. I added my United MP number since Turkish is a Star Alliance airline (even got to see one of their planes in Star Alliance livery in IST). You'll need to pay for seat selection. I always select an aisle.\n\nSFO-IST flight was a Boeing 787-9. Turkish apparently has only two classes: economy and business. Business configuration is very nice. Economy on the Dreamliner is a little rough space-wise. They use a 3-3-3 config. I do not recommend window seats unless it's for a kid. I made the mistake of obliging a family so they could seat together by taking the window seat from SFO to IST. That was rough – you can't extend both your legs straight. On the way back, another family asked for the same favor. Like a monster, I declined, and kept my aisle seat. 13 hours and some change in an aluminum tube is still rough, but at least it was easier to extend my legs and get some exercise.\n\nOh yes, families. Lots of them on Turkish Airlines flights. I felt like there were babies or toddlers in every row. Lots of babies crying. Didn't get much sleep either way.\n\nEntertainment system is a thing Turkish Airlines does pretty well. Great selection of Hollywood, Bollywood, Turkish, Asian and European movies, USB-A charging port, audio jacks (no Blutooth), camera selection on take-off/descent/landing, games for the kids, etc. There is a free wi-fi option for other devices and messaging I wasn't able to use though, maybe because it looks like it might only work if you booked the flight with with Turkish's Miles & Smiles loyalty program.\n\nThe food is actually very decent with Turkish Airlines when you compare it with that of transcontinental flights with most U.S. and European airlines in similar classes. You get to choose between two main dishes, and all meals are halal, but you can get wine (French or Turkish) at no extra cost as your drink. It was all pretty tasty.\n\nFAs will provide everyone with a blanket (very nice quality compared with many other major airlines) and a little vanity case containing an eye mask, slippers, socks, lip balm, etc.\n\nIstanbul airport is huge. Just be prepared for a little walking. There is an impressive amount of stores and restaurants, and the IGA Lounge is massive. When arriving from outside the airport, you'll have to go through security twice. A first screening, then passport control, then screening again.\n\nFlight to CDG from IST was an Airbus 321-200. My cabin luggage was gate-checked. Much more comfortable in economy with much wider and more comfortable seats than the 787. The Airbus 321neo from BCN to IST was similarly comfortable, but better equiped entertainment-wise (probably a more recent aircraft).\n\nBoarding with Turkish Airlines is a bit chaotic. They might call the seat rows in back half, but every flight I took with them, they never called the front-half (which is where I sat for all flights), so don't wait for it to be called – just get in line if you want to make sure you can use the overhead luggage space.\n\nSo, just to recap on costs: seat selection isn't free. Factor that in the flight costs. Also, if you have a layover in Istanbul, obviously factor in the price of the hotel, the food (very cheap unless you dine in overly touristy spots), and the cab fares (the metro option is worth exploring if you're on a budget, or if like me you enjoy exploring mass transit options in other countries – Istanbul's metro and tramways are pretty modern).\n\nOverall Turkish Airlines staff was friendly and competent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Flew with Turkish Airlines for the first time from the U.S. to Europe – two transatlantic flights, and two European flights. Would I do it again? Yes, probably: fares are attractive (including for open jaw trips), and bookending a trip with a night or more in Istanbul on one or both ends makes it interesting; also worth noting are the *two* checked-in pieces of luggage per passenger.",

    "text": "I'm a 27yo solo female traveler who recently did the Turkish Airlines stopover program. I've compiled a list of information because I found the process quite confusing and unclear.\n\n**What is it?** Turkish airlines offers free hotel accommodation in Istanbul, if your connection period is at least 20 hours. If you are economy class, they offer a 4-star hotel, and 5-star for business class.\n\n**How do you do it?**\n\n1. First you need to select a flight that has at least 20 hours of transit time between the two flights. I was flying from Norway to Australia, so having a stopover in a nice hotel seemed like a good option before a 20-hour long haul. I felt this program seemed a little too good to be true, or gimmicky, but decided to try it out anyway. After purchasing your flight, you can email the airline [FREEHOTELAUSTRALIA@THY.COM](mailto:FREEHOTELAUSTRALIA@THY.COM) to book the hotel of your choosing. Here is a list of the hotels they offer for economy:\n\n* Armada Hotel İstanbul\n\n* Eresin Hotels Topkapı\n\n* Grand Cevahir Hotel\n\n* Grand Yavuz Hotel\n\n* Ramada Plaza by Wyndham İstanbul Ataköy\n\n* Sheraton İstanbul Ataköy Hotel\n\n* Vialand Palace Hotel\n\n* Wish More Hotel Şişli\n\n* Wish More Hotel Bayrampaşa\n\n2. They send you a booking slip to complete, and you fill in your flight number, details, and departure information. **Specify which hotel you want to stay in before you submit the booking slip.** I did not specify, and was put in a random hotel not on the list, which was a little far out from the city. This felt a bit sneaky, as there is nowhere on the booking slip that let's you choose the hotel. If I was to do this again, I would get written confirmation there is availability at the hotel of your choosing, and then submit the booking slip with the hotel of your choosing clearly listed in the email and on the booking slip. I was unable to change my hotel, and the customer service team were very unhelpful. This is a hidden condition in their policy: \"The hotel voucher cannot be changed after it has been issued by the system.\" I ended up staying in the Dedeman hotel, and it was pretty average. I think people were smoking in the hotel, as it smelt like musty cigarettes, and the location was not great. You can book a hotel as a group or family - they will accommodate you in the same room.\n\n3. Once you have received the booking slip, you do not need to contact the hotel to book anything. I just showed up on the day and they had a room booked for me. The airline will not organise any transport for you. Istanbul airport is quite far from the city centre, and a taxi fare is expensive. I took the metro (M11), and it was great. I would highly recommend utilising the public transport to and from the airport, it's reliable, cheap and I felt very safe travelling at night.\n\n4. **Organise your e-visa.** Not to be confused with a Turkish 'transit visa' (this is unrelated to any stopover or short-stay in Türkiye). You are required to apply for an electronic visa, which was more expensive than I anticipated (yes I should have checked first, but hindsight is bliss - hence this post). My total costs of my visa were USD$66.00 (AUD$104.29).\n\n**Perks:** Hotel was nice-ish, good inclusions (breakfast was amazing - so much food, gym), lovely staff, check in and check out was convenient for me and they held onto my luggage so I could explore the city. Exploring Istanbul in 22 hours was really fun! Hotels have discounted prices for Stopover passengers. If you want to extend your stay, you can contact the Hotel and get information about the special prices for Stopover passengers.\n\n**Cons:** Expensive e-visa, confusing booking process and inflexibility to change hotel voucher, average hotel far from the city centre - I ended up spending quite a bit on taxis.\n\n**Miscellaneous tips:** If you are a solo female traveler, I would **not** stay on the European side. I was on this side and it felt a bit sketchy being alone at night, and there appears to be more petty crime. It's also a bit gridlocked taking a taxi from the European side to the Asian side. However, I felt quite safe in Istanbul generally, and just used common sense. Kadıköy feels very safe at night - would recommend exploring nightlife in this region. Turkish airlines offers **student discounted flights.** Register your status as a student in your Miles & Smiles account (provide student ID) and when you search for a flight, select 'Student' as the passenger. Some flights offer student seats which were really affordable!\n\n**TLDR:** The Turkish Airlines stopover program feels like a gimmick. Once you pay for the e-visa, food, transport etc. the 'money saved' from the free hotel outweighs the money spent. I might do the stopover again, if I could choose my hotel and it was more central.\n\n ",

    "title": "Claiming flight compensation with Turkish Airlines (SHY passenger rights)",
    "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nAs I could not find lots of helpful information on claiming compensation from **Turkish Airlines** when a flight is **delayed or cancelled** (including when you **miss your connecting flight**), I wanted to share my experience and how I got my compensation even though the flight is not eligible under the EU regulation.\n\n\n\n**Situation:**\n\nI had a booked a flight from Africa to Europe with a 1h layover in Istanbul. The flight from Africa was delayed by 50 min due to technical issues, which caused me missing the connection flight in Istanbul. I was rebooked to the next flight and eventually arrived 4h 51min after the planned arrival time.\n\nAs Turkish Airlines is not an EU airline and the starting airport was not an EU airport, the flight does not qualify under the European Regulation No 261/2004 that would have entitled me to a 600 EUR compensation for a flight of >3,500km.\n\nHowever, Turkey has a similar regulation called SHY passenger rights (https://web.shgm.gov.tr/doc4/shy-passenger.pdf) that is basically a copy/paste of the EU regulation and includes all Turkish Airlines flights. Your total delay has to be between 2h and 4h, depending on the distance of your flight to be entitled to a compensation of the equivalent of 250 to 600 EUR.\n\nMost people do not know about this Turkish regulation, including the online tools that help you claim compensation for flight delays in Europe. Therefore, you have to do it yourself if you want to get your money.\n\n\n\n**How to claim the compensation yourself:**\n\n* You need to **submit a feedback via the Turkish Airlines website** (https://www.turkishairlines.com/en-int/any-questions/customer-relations/feedback/) in which you outline the delay and request the compensation in accordance with the SHY regulation. Specify the exact total delay of your arrival at your final destination (use [https://www.flightera.net/en/](https://www.flightera.net/en/) to find out the exact total delay of your final leg of the flight. Note that only the final leg counts. If your first leg is delayed and you can still make the connection flight, your flight is not considered delayed) and the bank account of where the compensation should be transferred. If you were rebooked, to another flight your actual arrival time matters. To make matters more smooth, you should attach to your claim:\n   * A copy of your passport\n   * Copies of the boarding passes used (screenshot of mobile passes are fine)\n   * A confirmation that the bank account is actually yours (if your debit card states the IBAN, that is fine)\n   * Optional: If you were rebooked, the confirmation email that you were rebooked to another flight\n   * Optional: Additional costs incurred due to the delay (food, drinks, hotel, transport)\n* In my case, they got back to me within a couple hours. They acknowledged the delay but were **unwilling to pay the compensation** due to some (invalid - more about that later) court ruling:\n\n>*However, we regret to inform you that we’re unable to pay compensation for flight \\[...\\], which was delayed by 47 minutes due to technical reasons and caused you miss your following flight. We have found that you had completed your trip with the flight \\[...\\].*\n\n* In this case, you can **submit the claim directly to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation** (Sivil Havacılık Genel Müdürlüğü) via this link: https://yh.shgm.gov.tr/. The website is in Turkish so use Google Chromes translation feature. However, some fields cannot be fille when the translation feature is turned on. So you might need to turn it on and off when filling the form. For the selection of the airline, you need to search for Turkish Airline's ICAO abbreviation which is THY and stands for Türk Hava Yolları. For the airport, you need to search for İstanbul Havalimanı - note that the i is not the normal i but the Turkish letter İ. I further adapted the claim I made to Turkish Airlines and added that the airline is not willing to compensate me. I used Chat-GPT to translate the claim to Turkish (I would assume they just ignore English claims) but google translate also works. I also attached the email I got from Turkish Airlines to proof that I tried contacting them directly.\n* A few hours later, I was **called by a Turkish Airlines agent** on the phone number I left with the Directorate. The asked if I personally submitted the claim which I confirmed. They then hung up without specifying anything further. I don't know why they do that, but I guess you need to file the claim yourself otherwise it could be invalid?\n* A few hours later, I got an email in Turkish from the Directorate (received from [yh@shgm.gov.tr](mailto:yh@shgm.gov.tr)) that stated that I am **entitled to the compensation** of the equivalent of 600 EUR in Turkish Lira and just a couple minutes afterwards I got an email from Turkish Airlines (received from [noreply.tkcustomer@thy.com](mailto:noreply.tkcustomer@thy.com)) in English  that they accepted my request and that I can pick up the cheque from the next Turkish Airlines ticket office (they do not seem to transfer the money directly). While I traveled alone, the **compensation you're entitled to is on a per-passenger basis** and is not to be shared across the passengers on a booking. Meaning that if I had traveled with 2 other family members, I would have been entitled to 1,800 EUR (3x 600 EUR) instead of 600 EUR.\n* A few days later, I went to the Turkish Airlines ticket office in the city I live in (they also would have had one at the airport) where they requested my passport and the confirmation of the compensation. At first, they had trouble finding my claim as the confirmation email did not state any cheque-ID. The staff was friendly and did some 10 min manual search in the system. They then told me that they (i.e., the ticket office) will do a **wire transfer to my bank account within 21 days**. I got a printed confirmation of this and an hour later or so an email confirming this.\n* **10 working days** (or 12 days) after my visit at the ticket office, I had the compensation of 600 EUR in my bank account. Surprisingly, they transferred the full 600 EUR and not the complicated calculation of the equivalent of 600 EUR in TLR based on the exchange rate on the day of booking\n\n\n\nAll this seems complicated but due to the super fast response times from both Turkish Airlines and the Directorate, from the first contact to the confirmation of the compensation entitlement took less than 24h. Definitely a good use of time for a 600 EUR payout.\n\n\n\nHope this helps some fellow Turkish Airlines passengers getting their compensation payments which they are entitled to!\n\n  \nThanks to everyone in the comments below who provided additional details to keep this guide updated.",

      "Hello, I wanted to thank for your post as it's helped secure compensation for both flights (24 hours delay on the way to Tbilisi, 12 hours on the way back!). I also wanted to add that once I received my 'cheque' from Turkish Airlines,  I emailed my local sales office to ask if there was anyway to receive the money without having to travel to an airport. They immediately emailed back asking me to email them a copy of my passport and a bank transfer form. I thought I'd let everyone know, so that you can all try in your respective cities and avoid travelling all the way to an airport or sales office!",
      "Thanks for the detailed steps.  \nSame thing happened to me, although instead of refusing to compensate, Turkish Airlines want to offer 30000 bonus miles after 3 weeks investigation. I've just sent a complaint to the Directorate. Will let you know how it goes.",
      "First, I just want to say THANK YOU as this post gave me the energy to fight for my compensation. \n\nMy experience with Turkish Airlines was that they try to waste your time as long as they can, hoping you'll give up. DON'T GIVE UP, YOU ARE ENTITELD TO YOUR MONEY.\n\n1. After filling out their feedback form (only way to complain about a flight delay), I received an automatic response telling me that it will take 7 to 14 days to get a response from them.\n\n2. After this time I received another automatic response that \"they strive to solve my issue\".\n\n3. Then I finally received their first offer: 30.000 bonus miles for their Miles & Smiles cliub. Of course, I refused. I had to follow up on my feedback form telling them so, and received the same automatic response that it will take another 7 to 14 days for them to get back to me.\n\n4. Since I felt like I don't want to waste my time any longer HERE IS WHAT HELPED IN MY CASE: I commented on every recent post on their social channels, mainly facebook and Instagram (copy+paste). I told my whole story and other people supported my post. Just watch out for fake accounts who suddenly want to help you with links, they even have names like \"Turkish Help Desk\" etc.\n\nAs their social media managers have to react it didn't take them long to write me DMs.\n\n5. Suddenly, I received another email with a new offer:\n\n1. Instead of the bonus miles we have specified in our previous reply, we can credit 42.000 Bonus Miles to your Miles&Smiles membership account.\n2. We can credit 18.000 Status Miles to your Miles&Smiles membership account.\n3. If you prefer, we can issue a traveler’s cheque that is worth 720.00 Euros that you can use to pay for ticket purchases on Turkish Airlines and AnadoluJet flights.\n4. As an alternative to all these offers, we can issue a refund cheque that is worth 600.00 Euros that you can get in cash.\n\nIMPORTANT: I was finally allowed to reply to this email directly within 48 hours. I wrote back IN TURKISH (with google translate) that I'm choosing option 4, and I received another email with my refund cheque ON THE NEXT DAY.\n\nTo use this cheque there were different options, and since I didn't trust them enough to use their website for my bank account details, I went to the nearest sales office, which luckily is in the city center in my hometown Vienna. There, they only needed to scan my passport and debit card. They told me it will take up to four(!) weeks to transfer the money, and three weeks later I got my 600 euro. THE END."

    "title": "I did the Turkish airlines stopover and compiled all the information so you don't have to",
    "text": "I'm a 27yo solo female traveler who recently did the Turkish Airlines stopover program. I've compiled a list of information because I found the process quite confusing and unclear. \n\n**What is it?** Turkish airlines offers free hotel accommodation in Istanbul, if your connection period is at least 20 hours. If you are economy class, they offer a 4-star hotel, and 5-star for business class. \n\n**How do you do it?** \n\n1. First you need to select a flight that has at least 20 hours of transit time between the two flights. I was flying from Norway to Australia, so having a stopover in a nice hotel seemed like a good option before a 20-hour long haul. I felt this program seemed a little too good to be true, or gimmicky, but decided to try it out anyway. After purchasing your flight, you can email the airline [FREEHOTELAUSTRALIA@THY.COM](mailto:FREEHOTELAUSTRALIA@THY.COM) to book the hotel of your choosing. Here is a list of the hotels they offer for economy:\n\n* Armada Hotel İstanbul\n* Eresin Hotels Topkapı\n* Grand Cevahir Hotel\n* Grand Yavuz Hotel\n* Ramada Plaza by Wyndham İstanbul Ataköy \n* Sheraton İstanbul Ataköy Hotel\n* Vialand Palace Hotel\n* Wish More Hotel Şişli\n* Wish More Hotel Bayrampaşa\n\n2. They send you a booking slip to complete, and you fill in your flight number, details, and departure information. **Specify which hotel you want to stay in before you submit the booking slip.** I did not specify, and was put in a random hotel not on the list, which was a little far out from the city. This felt a bit sneaky, as there is nowhere on the booking slip that let's you choose the hotel. If I was to do this again, I would get written confirmation there is availability at the hotel of your choosing, and then submit the booking slip with the hotel of your choosing clearly listed in the email and on the booking slip. I was unable to change my hotel, and the customer service team were very unhelpful. This is a hidden condition in their policy: \"The hotel voucher cannot be changed after it has been issued by the system.\" I ended up staying in the Dedeman hotel, and it was pretty average. I think people were smoking in the hotel, as it smelt like musty cigarettes, and the location was not great. You can book a hotel as a group or family - they will accommodate you in the same room. \n\n3. Once you have received the booking slip, you do not need to contact the hotel to book anything. I just showed up on the day and they had a room booked for me. The airline will not organise any transport for you. Istanbul airport is quite far from the city centre, and a taxi fare is expensive. I took the metro (M11), and it was great. I would highly recommend utilising the public transport to and from the airport, it's reliable, cheap and I felt very safe travelling at night. \n\n4. **Organise your e-visa.** Not to be confused with a Turkish 'transit visa' (this is unrelated to any stopover or short-stay in Türkiye). You are required to apply for an electronic visa, which was more expensive than I anticipated (yes I should have checked first, but hindsight is bliss - hence this post). My total costs of my visa were USD$66.00 (AUD$104.29). \n\n**Perks:** Hotel was nice-ish, good inclusions (breakfast was amazing - so much food, gym), lovely staff, check in and check out was convenient for me and they held onto my luggage so I could explore the city. Exploring Istanbul in 22 hours was really fun! Hotels have discounted prices for Stopover passengers. If you want to extend your stay, you can contact the Hotel and get information about the special prices for Stopover passengers.\n\n**Cons:** Expensive e-visa, confusing booking process and inflexibility to change hotel voucher, average hotel far from the city centre - I ended up spending quite a bit on taxis. \n\n**Miscellaneous tips:** If you are a solo female traveler, I would **not** stay on the European side. I was on this side and it felt a bit sketchy being alone at night, and there appears to be more petty crime. It's also a bit gridlocked taking a taxi from the European side to the Asian side. However, I felt quite safe in Istanbul generally, and just used common sense. Kadıköy feels very safe at night - would recommend exploring nightlife in this region. Turkish airlines offers **student discounted flights.** Register your status as a student in your Miles & Smiles account (provide student ID) and when you search for a flight, select 'Student' as the passenger. Some flights offer student seats which were really affordable! \n\n**TLDR:** The Turkish Airlines stopover program feels like a gimmick. Once you pay for the e-visa, food, transport etc. the 'money saved' from the free hotel outweighs the money spent. I might do the stopover again, if I could choose my hotel and it was more central.",

Nice seats, good Turkish inspired cuisine with hot rolls and a cheese selection, unlimited drinks including spirits and mixers, spacious modern aircraft and excellent entertainment choices. Outside the big Middle Eastern airlines, they were definitely the best. Not anymore.\n\nI've flown long-haul with them three times in the past six months and each time it's been god-awful. Less knee room than Ryan Air, terrible food, very limited drinks, chaotic service. The flight I took recently which was 10 hours, was genuinely the worst flight I've ever been on. I'm 6'2\" and I ended up with aching knees and zero sleep. It's as though they've added more seats to their planes, made the food and drinks way worse and not updated anything for years. Terrible. Anybody else think the same, or should I just expect a bad experience on a long-haul Economy flight? I also took a long-haul Eurowings flight operated by Brussels Airlines on the same journey as the one listed above and it was far far nicer that the one on Turkish so that says a lot.\n\nAs an aside, I also really really dislike the new(ish) Istanbul airport. Consumerist nonsense. Enormous, chaotic, and so overpriced it makes Dubai seem cheap. Nothing useful there like a pharmacy, just crappy Gucci clothes and faux Turkish souvenir nonsense. Turkey used to be the hub of decent travel, now it's main airport and national airline are rock bottom of the list in both categories for me.",

Chose them as the business fare plus schedules were very competitive - this is personal travel so I try to look for value. \n\nTwice return flight was either delayed or cancelled which meant that we missed our onward connections. Yes they did rebook us on subsequent flights but makes me wonder on their planning - 2 out of 3 is bad.\n\nOn all legs (12), except 2, the planes were small A320s which meant no lie flat seats. And even on the 2 that were bigger planes, it was the old business and I dont recall that the seats were fully lie flat.  The service was OK but the staff on multiple occasions seemed to be in a bad mood. You ask for anything and they make it seem like a chore.\n\nThe new Istanbul Airport, I hate. It's chaotic and a mess. The TK lounge (the one that is exclusive for business) seems to be good with nice food options on the first glance but a closer look shows that the sofas have stains on them and hygiene is not up to par. The staff also seems to have an attitude.\n\nDon't even get me started on the passport checks before boarding. You have to get passport checked and pass stamped before going into the boarding process. That creates another scene of chaos. \n\nAnd on one occasion I ran into a rude employee who didn't understand what visa free access means. She kept insisting to see my hotel bookings and wanting to take photographs of them. I politely explained multiple times that this applies to visa on arrival passengers (airline can check if they are complying with conditions of visa) but for visa free, only arrival immigration can ask me..... As if they turn me back, airline won't be penalised. This went on and on until finally I lost it when I saw when she wasn't giving other passengers this level of scrutiny (white passengers and in economy). So I straight up asked her, is it because I am brown?   She literally said yes.  Then I repeated the question and this is when she realised that she had fucked up..... So started on, oh my English isn't good blah blah...at which a supervisor who was standing there silent, noticed my business boarding pass, stepped in, apologised and waved me through.   I complained after the fact.... Ironically using the free WiFi on the plane 😂..... To their credit, Turkish sent me an email saying that they investigated, saw the CCTV footage and took disciplinary action against the staff.\n\nThe point I am making is that when you have a crappy hard product (seats and so on), you need to compensate with the soft product. Unfortunately, for them, the soft product is even worse due to attitudes and lack of customer service. And the cherry on the cake and I may be generalising here, but a lot of staff, to me, came across as borderline or openly racist (like the example above). So from this year, I had enough. Shifted to Qatar and Gulf air. Yes it's more expensive but the hard product is excellent for the most part (Qatar A350 and Gulf 787s) with soft product following along (Qatar by far).",

Everything was fine,  I got the ticket number, booking reference and everything.\n\nThen came the previous day of flight, I tried to check-in online, but it said \"There was an issue with one of your flights, please visit the check-in counter at the airport to check-in\".\n\nSo the next day i went to the Denver airport Turkish airlines counter. The staff said there is some issue, and that they are not able to see my reservation on their system, even after me showing the email confirmation and e-ticket.\n\nHow is it my problem? But they said they couldn't do anything, and asked me to contact customer care. So there I was, speaking with the customer care in the airport for close to 3hrs, and ya'll know good they are. I obviously didn't get a solution.\n\nFinally the check-in staff said there was a technical issue, and asked me to fill the feedback form for a refund and to book another ticket through the website immediately. I ofc couldn't find a ticket on the same flight or for the next couple of days ( it was winter break ).\n\nIt was almost closing time for boarding and I was standing there helpless, humiliated. It slowly hit me that I wasn't flying that day, and I ended up booking another last-minute flight for the next day through Air France.\n\nSince then I have been trying to contact them.. but even their reply to the feedback form is just bs.\n\nWhat do i do?\n\nAlso created a twitter post, but i don't have sufficient reach - [https://x.com/Akash774367/status/1873264183141360010](https://x.com/Akash774367/status/1873264183141360010)\n\nEDIT - I was able to see my reservation ( both the onward and return journey ) on the system till the prev day of the incident, after that I'm only able to see the return journey in the website now ( which is in a couple of days )\n\nEDIT - I got my money refunded through a credit card chargeback !!

    "title": "United/Turkish Airlines Baggage Policy Mismatch - Beware Award Bookings!",
    "text": "Heads up to anyone booking United Airlines flights with points that are operated by partner Turkish Airlines – I just ran into a seriously frustrating and costly issue.\nI booked my recent flights through the United app using United points. The booking confirmation from United clearly stated an allowance of two free checked bags per person.\nHowever, upon checking in with Turkish Airlines, I was informed my ticket had zero free baggage allowance. This was a complete surprise, as I've never encountered this on a ticket booked through a major airline like United.\nDespite showing them my Unit\ned confirmation, Turkish Airlines insisted on charging me. The cost? A staggering $290 per bag, one way. Even with my Star Alliance Gold status granting me one free bag, I still had to pay $580. I'm now facing another $580 for the return.\nSpeaking with both United and Turkish Airlines, I was told that Turkish Airlines implemented a policy change in January 2025 introducing \"economy fares\" internationally with no free checked baggage. Apparently, this is the fare class I was booked into by United.\nI'm incredibly disappointed by this disconnect between United's booking information and Turkish Airlines' actual policy. If I had known about this, I would have reconsidered using my points this way. It feels misleading that United's confirmation showed a baggage allowance that wasn't honored.\nHas anyone else experienced similar issues when booking partner airline flights with United points? It seems crucial for @UnitedAirlines to ensure the information displayed during booking accurately reflects the operating carrier's policies. This lack of transparency has turned my \"free\" flight into a very expensive one.\n\n\n🚨 Update 🚨\nI just checked in for my return flight from DXB back to Houston. I spoke with the Turkish airline manager there and He actually admitted that United does this all the time and called it a glitch. He looked in the system and found that my original ticket, the one United initially issued, did include baggage. He explained that if there's even a slight schedule change or something that triggers a ticket reissuance, United's system glitches and defaults to a fare with zero bags. He waived my baggage fees and said he'll take it up with United. \n\nBased on this, if anyone ever has an award tickets, and it gets reissued for various reasons by the airline being flown, the reissued ticket will give zero baggage allowance. As soon as the reissuance happens, call united and ask them to confirm the allotted baggage allowance on the newly issued tickets as the original shows allowance vs new one shows zero. This is insane to me as United still hasn't caught or is willing to fix this from an IT standpoint.\n\n#UnitedAirlines #TurkishAirlines #BaggagePolicy #TravelTips #PointRedemption #awardtravel #CustomerExperience #StarAlliance",

It wouldn’t be so frustrating if their inflated baggage fees weren’t a complete ripoff. \n\nThis also applies for business tickets.

That has its limitations as well, since there’s a weight limit for carry ons and the overage fees are killer. Thankfully they didn’t weigh my bag on the outbound flight but were doing so in Dubai on the return. I was traveling with a friend who booked J on cash, so they were able to check my bag for free under their name. \n\nFull agree that United needs to fix this. I have seen some reports of people getting refunds from United if they submit a request, but YMMV.",

    "title": "March 2025: Turkish Airlines Stopover Program",
    "text": "I wanted to share my experience with the Turkish Airlines Stopover Program in Istanbul, which my husband and I used on our recent trip from the U.S. to Russia and back. Before our trip, I spent a lot of time researching how it works, so I figured our experience might be helpful to others.\n\n⸻\n\nWhat is the Turkish Airlines Stopover Program?\n\nThe Stopover Program offers passengers with long layovers in Istanbul a free hotel stay - three nights for Business Class and two nights for Economy Class - when flying to and from the U.S. Other destinations may have different hotel night quotas. All flights must be on the same reservation.\n\nAfter booking your flight, go to the Turkish Airlines website, find the Stopover Program page, and enter your reservation details. If you qualify, you’ll receive a list of hotels to choose from. There are plenty of options, but most are at least an hour away from the airport by metro, closer to Istanbul’s historic districts.\n\nThe list of hotels may change based on Turkish Airlines’ agreements. Here’s the list we received in February 2025:\n\n* Eresin Hotels Topkapı\n* Grand Cevahir Hotel\n* Wish More Hotel Istanbul\n* Vialand Palace Hotel\n* Mövenpick Hotel İstanbul Marmara Sea\n* Wish More Hotel Şişli\n* Ramada Plaza by Wyndham İstanbul Ataköy\n* Hyatt Regency Istanbul Ataköy\n* Dedeman Hotel Gayrettepe\n\nWe chose Mövenpick Hotel İstanbul Marmara Sea, and we couldn’t have been happier. It was just a three-minute walk from the Marmaray metro line, making it incredibly easy to get around. The surrounding area is still developing, but the hotel itself was fantastic - modern, clean, and comfortable. The staff was welcoming, the rooms were well-designed, and the included breakfast was far better than what you’d typically get at an American hotel.\n\n⸻\n\nGetting to the Hotel by Metro\n\nWe had heard that Istanbul taxi drivers often overcharge tourists, so we decided to stick with public transportation.\n\nAfter landing, go through passport control, customs, and exit the airport following the signs. Outside, you’ll see red “M” metro signs leading to the Istanbul Havalimani metro station. To use public transportation, you’ll need to purchase an Istanbulkart (the city’s transit card) from a vending machine.\n\nTip: Pay in cash at these machines. Many travelers had trouble using credit cards or Apple Pay - their transactions were frequently declined.\n\nAs of March 2025, the Istanbulkart costs 130 TL, and we loaded ours with 270 TL - enough for two people to get to the hotel. The great thing is that one card can be shared between multiple travelers, so you don’t need to buy separate ones.\n\n⸻\n\nMoney Exchange & Tipping\n\nI originally considered exchanging USD for Turkish Lira through Bank of America, but I wasn’t sure if the money would arrive in time with standard delivery, and I didn’t want to pay extra for express shipping on a small amount.\n\nAt Istanbul Airport, after passing duty-free, you’ll see several currency exchange counters. Avoid exchanging money there - their rates are terrible. Instead, walk a little further into the arrivals hall, where you’ll find actual bank-run exchange counters (like QNB Finansbank, Türkiye İş Bankası, etc.) that offer much better rates - sometimes even better than what you’d get in the U.S.\n\nWe exchanged $100 at QNB, which was enough to cover metro fares, small tips, and luggage storage (more on that below).\n\nTipping in Turkey is different from in the U.S. Based on my research, a 10% tip in restaurants is more than enough if you’re happy with the service. It’s not required, but it is appreciated.\n\nOf course, how much cash you’ll need depends on your spending habits, but we preferred using credit cards whenever possible. Bank of America, Capital One, and Apple Cards (Visa & Mastercard) worked without any issues. We didn’t have an American Express, so I can’t confirm how widely it’s accepted.\n\n⸻\n\nLuggage Storage\n\nIf your layover is longer than 24 hours, you’ll have to collect your checked baggage at baggage claim.\n\nWe had two carry-ons, one large suitcase, and two backpacks. Since the metro ride to our hotel was nearly two hours with three transfers, we decided to store one carry-on and the large suitcase at the airport.\n\nThere are two luggage storage facilities in the arrivals area; one is right next to the Turkish Airlines Hotel Desk, and they’re called “Left Baggage”. In March 2025, we paid 1,200 TL to store one carry-on and one large suitcase for 47 hours.\n\nTip: Exchange money before using the storage service. While they accept USD and EUR, their exchange rate is terrible. For example, we paid 1,200 TL, but they also offered to take $40 instead, which was a bad deal.\n\n⸻\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe Stopover Program was absolutely worth it. The two-day break between flights was a great way to break up a long journey and explore Istanbul, and the free hotel stay made it even better.\n",

This was my post:\n\nI'm a former CEO, blog on Indian national security and briefly worked in an Indian carrier in a senior position. I have also lived and worked in Turkiye, so my understanding of its govt policy is not just what I read in the media here.\n\nAfter the Turkish earthquake, India rushed aid to save lives. After Pakistan's terror attack against us, Turkiye rushed weapons to kill us.\n\n8 major Indian airports have their cargo handled by a Turkish company - Celebi Aviation, considered close to President Erdogan. That is a huge security risk.  \nImagine bombs being placed on multiple aircraft\n\nIndians flying to Istanbul visa Indigo or its partner Turkish Airlines, give more money to Turkiye than the value of Turkish arms exports to Pak. Turkish airlines, owned by the Turkish govt, therefore endorses state sponsored terror and does not recognise Kashmir as part of India.\n\nDoes, Indigo, by extension, endorse that policy ? If not, they should terminate operations to Istanbul. It is not possible to prevent all Indians from going to Turkiye, but we can stop the one Indian airline that flies there - the govt should ban the other. We have a policy of not allowing Chinese companies to bid on projects that concern national security. I'm asking for the same standard to apply to Turkish companies.\n\nIf you agree, please forward to people in your circle who might be able to influence this.\n\nEdit: I have written to the ministry, to the CEO of Indigo and a couple of senior journalists handling aviation, but more pressure is needed.",

It’s about making a conscious choice to refrain from spending even a single rupee in countries that actively and openly supported our adversary during a time of war. If it wasn't for our robust defence systems, the civilian and infra casualties would have been severe. We extended aid and tourism support to them, and in return they supplied open support and ammunition to a terrorist state. That sirs is completely unacceptable.\n\nThank you for bringing to our attention that the cargo operations of eight major Indian airports are being handled by a Turkish company.

They have a clutch so you can easily override the plane if you don't like what it does. Here the thrust moved to idle much too early and the pilots only needed to push it back to where it had been. Their hands should have been on the thrust levers and felt it well outside of normal position, their eyes should have been on the airspeed and seen it decrease. This should have been super trivial. And yet the thrust levers were at idle for 100 seconds and the plane's speed decreased well below what it should ever be in flight, all at a time where both pilots should be fully dialed in to monitoring these things.\n\n\nYeah it's hip to knock Boeing these days, but no plane is faultless and at some point you have to expect pilots to be able to handle little stuff that pops up. Here they failed. ",

I fell in love with the sheer vastness of the landscapes, an absolute sense of isolation, the diversity in terrain and weather, Milky Way views every night, wildflower strewn grasslands, the herds of wild horses and yaks, the hospitality of the nomadic families, and the exhilarating sense of adventure that shrouds you during every moment \n\nI spent around 65k on return flights - Turkish Airlines, Mumbai-Istanbul-Ulaanbataar and back the same route.

Accomodation was in yurts/Ger camps and with nomadic families; basic facilities with even more basic toilet/shower facilities - a bit tough out there, but the views compensate for it.

      "On 3 March 1974, the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 operating the flight crashed into the Ermenonville Forest, outside Paris, killing all 346 people on board.\n\nThe crash occurred when an incorrectly secured cargo door at the rear of the plane burst open and broke off, **causing an explosive decompression that severed critical cables necessary to control the aircraft.**\n\nTo maximize the working space within the cargo hold, the cargo doors opened outwards, making them vulnerable to being forced open at high altitudes under normal in-flight pressure. To prevent this, a special latching system was used that locked shut under pressure when properly closed. To ensure the latches were properly positioned, a handle on the outside of the door pressed small metal pins into the latches; if the latches were in an improper location the pins would not align and the handle would not close.\n\nIn previous service, notably an incident that occurred on American Airlines Flight 96 **in 1972, it had been noticed that it was possible to close the handle on DC-10 cargo doors despite the latches being in the wrong position.** This was because the linkage between the handle and the pins was too weak and allowed the handle to be forced into the closed position.\\[4\\]\n\nA minor change had been ordered to install a support plate for the handle linkage to make it stronger; manufacturer **documents showed this work as completed on the aircraft involved in Flight 981, but the plate had not in fact been installed. It was also noted that the handle on the crash aircraft had been filed down at an earlier date to make it easier to close the door.**\n\nFinally, the latching had been performed by a baggage handler who did not speak Turkish or English, the only languages provided on a warning notice about the cargo door's design flaws and the methods of compensating for them. After the disaster, the latches were redesigned and the locking system significantly upgraded.In the following investigation, it was found that a similar set of conditions, which had caused the failure of an aircraft floor following explosive decompression of the cargo hold, had occurred in ground testing in 1970 before the DC-10 series entered commercial service.\n\n**The smoking gun was a** memo from the fuselage's manufacturer, Convair, to McDonnell Douglas, in which the series of events that occurred on Flight 96, and fatally on Flight 981, was foreseen; it concluded that if these events occurred it would probably result in the loss of the aircraft. In spite of this warning, nothing was done to correct the flaw. The consequences of this were many, including – but not limited to – some of the largest civil lawsuits to that date.",

This contradictory reasoning blew my mind.\n\nI was also denied lounge access and had to sped 24 hours in the airport sleeping on the floor/rock hard chairs. It was evident that their focus was on selling tickets rather than ensuring passenger comfort. This wasn't the first time I had issues with this airline; I've flown with them five times and each time reminded me why I dislike their service. In the future, I'm willing to pay more to support an airline that genuinely cares about travelers and provides a better experience."

    "title": "Turkish Airlines Doesn't Care About You",
    "text": "Hi. I want to start this by saying that this post is meant as a personal vent and for commiseration with anyone else that has jumped through hoops only for Turkish Airlines to still leave you hanging. I have never done something like this and don't like doing this. It makes me feel icky. But sometimes corporate nonsense and bad customer service make you feel so powerless that the only thing left to do is vent. And also vote with your dollar, but it's too late on that one for me this time.\n\n**So here's the situation:**\n\nMy wife and I got married about a month ago (woo!), and we are leaving on our honeymoon tomorrow on a Turkish Airlines flight. Our first flight is 12 hours. So not a short one. I also have a bum knee. So this morning I got on the website to try and reserve some seats. I just want to maybe get us some roomier seats as a little splurge and at the very least get myself an aisle seat so I can stretch my leg.\n\nI pick our seats and enter my card info and get an error that just essentially says, \"Couldn't book your seats please try again.\" No context as to why. So I try again. Same issue. So I check my credit card, and what do you know, it's been charged twice.\n\nSo next I call their customer service line. I've had a good experience there before! This should be easy! Wrong... The gentleman I spoke with said that he can't refund the money but that it should come off in a few days but that he can't send me an email to verify that it will. He also then said that he was unable to select seats for us for a reason he couldn't totally articulate (some technical issues on their end) and that the only way to book seats on our flight was to wait until we were checking in with the agent before our flight or to go to the airport today and talk to them. I asked him why it would be working for other people and not us, and he didn't have an answer. When I asked if there was anyone else to talk to that might have more power to help us, he refused. When I asked for any info about how to contact the Turkish Airlines people in my airport, he couldn't help. When I asked if there was literally anything he could do to help, I was met with crickets. So 0/6 on that one with no remorse or understanding for the situation. Not ideal. But I really didn't want to take the risk of not being able to stretch my leg for the whole flight, so I thought, \"Hey, I'll take my lunch and go to the airport and get my seat booked. How hard could it be?\"\n\nTurns out, hard\n\nI get to the airport and go to the Turkish Airlines check-in area and there is no one from Turkish Airlines there. I should have known. But they don't have agents there except near flight times and there were no outbound flights near that time. But I listened to the guy on the phone who said that there would be someone there, naively. So I think, \"Hey I have United status. Let me go talk to them since they are in the same alliance. Maybe they can get me in touch with someone who could help.\" So I did and the United people were awesome. They connected me to their internal Turkish booking people and let me stand there for 25 minutes and hog a check-in lane while the lady on the phone and I HAD THE EXACT SAME CONVERSATION THAT THE GUY AND I HAD EARLIER. Same result: We don't know why this is only failing for you, we can't help you, and you have no options until you check in tomorrow, and if all the aisles are booked, then you're out of luck.\n\nSo then I give up.\n\nBecause it's really not that big of a deal. It's 12 hours in a plane. I can deal with whatever it is. But during the whole experience, no one had one ounce of understanding or remorse or even just a \"Hey, I am sorry this is happening to you. This is our bad and we apologize.\" Every person I talked to couldn't have cared less. Which I am sure has less to do with them than the higher-up decisions that bubble down and leave them powerless. But whatever it is, it results in a terrible customer experience.  \n  \nSo that's what it's about.  \n  \nNot a seat, not the time and money wasted, but just the general attitude of disdain for even trying to help your customer with what should be a routine task.\n\nAnd with that I end my rant. Time to get hyped for a honeymoon!\n\n",

      "I can't help you at all. But for future travelers, perhaps its not the best idea to use a photo of an email from a  Central American country's South Asian embassy to prove to fourth-country airport staff that you are authorized to travel to an entirely different and South East Asian country, even if that convoluted visa scheme is in fact, correct.\n\nI'm absolutely not trying to insult you, OP. If you had that entitlement then you had that entitlement. But I can see how it would all seem very sketchy and unbelievable to a low-salary gate agent, even if its their job to understand global visas. A travel partner of mine was once denied boarding in Ulaan Baatar because of the Mongolian gate agent's lack of understanding of the Chinese Transit Visa. There was nothing the guy could do. He was correct, and he had proper printouts of the Chinese Transit Visa from the Chinese government website. But the Mongolians didn't care. He got zero compensation for his 24-hour delay. Your scenario is even more fascinating than that one, but maybe just getting a Panamanian visa would have been better.\n\nLike I said, I can't help you, and I'm not trying to be a jerk about it. Its a really really interesting visa scheme though, one that I would not have trusted.\n\nEdited to say (for information purposes), the Panama visa scheme is an actual thing. OP did have the right to board! I think the problem was the photo of the email, rather than a more official printout of the Panama Visa Decree.\n\n\"**Article 1:** \"Any person of nationality who requires a visa to enter the Republic of Panama, who has a valid Visa or Residence, duly issued by Canada, the United States of America, the Commonwealth of Australia, the Republic of Korea, the State of Japan, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Republic of Singapore and any of the States that make up the European Union, may enter the national territory \"\n\nOP: I would enter a claim against Turkish Airlines, outlining your expenses, probably through their website and also via email.

At first I thought it was only for people with relatively weak passports flying into south america but it seems like even people with US passports are being denied. \n\nIs there any consistency to this and anything we can do to mitigate the risk of encountering this issue?

Disappointed in Turkish and after my next trip with them next month I will consider other options.  \n\n(Although general consensus, even from Indians, is that they can be difficult to deal with and those areas overlap with the Indian diaspora.)",
      "It is not the airline that is denying the boarding. It is the border police at the destination country that is denying the manifest based on passport particulars. TK will not carry you there, pay a fine and fly you back if the receiving country won’t take you",

Also they put the two of us in separate hotels despite us clearly stating we were traveling as a group and requesting the same stopover hotel.\n\nOn the way through IST for the first leg of our trip we tried to speak to the service desk in the international terminal and they just told us to call customer service (again). \n\nIs there anything we can do to fix this? Our stopover is in 7 days. At this point Turkish Airlines is scamming us-they advertised a service they had no intention of delivering on.\n\n1) any advice for resolving this with the airline?\n\n2) is there some sort of consumer protection agency in Turkey that I can report this to?

      "I would strongly recommend a longer transfer time. Istanbul airport is huge and not well organised for connections. There is a short transfer path which speeds it up but unless you are lucky with the gates, you'll still be walking 20+min. Boarding usually closes 20min prior to departure so this basically leaves you no buffer. If you are young and don't mind running through the airport, you can give it a shot though.\n\nAs for rebooking, I only had the case once and we were booked on the next flight but that one was 20h later as there were no flights in between.\n\nAlso note that Turkish Airways Customer support is useless when it comes to refund claims, e.g. if you miss the connection because of a delay on your first leg.\n\nHope that helps.",

I didn't notice until now, and it says my return flight ends in Istanbul and that's it. No flight to NYC. I called the travel agency six times, and all of them told me \"no the flights are confirmed\" and I told them no it isn't. I don't trust a random agency telling me all the flights are confirmed when I'm staring right at it that the NYC portion is missing. None of them wanted to help or offer a free change so that it forces the itinerary to update and show the NYC portion of the flight. After the sixth useless agent told me someone would call me back I gave up and called Turkish, who I explained the situation and said this was an involuntary change because this is not the flight I paid for. They also refused to help, telling me I needed to pay the full price for the change fee. I said at this point I don't care about it being free just give a discount so I can go home and they refused to do that either. I ended up paying $480 to change my flight to one day later which finally updated to show the NYC portion.\n\nIs there nothing I can do?

    "title": "How I Claimed Compensation from Turkish Airlines for a Delayed Flight",
    "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nIf you’ve ever experienced delays or missed connections with Turkish Airlines, you might be entitled to compensation—even if your flight doesn’t fall under EU regulations. I recently went through this process and successfully received my reimbursement. Here’s how I handled it.\n\n**TL;DR:** I followed u/tinmanthewoodman’s guide in r/Travel with a few differences and finally got my reimbursement.\n\n# My Experience\n\nI was flying from Dubai to Europe, with a layover in Istanbul. Unfortunately, I arrived at Istanbul Airport just as my connecting flight was departing, forcing me to spend the night in Istanbul—along with what felt like half the plane. We received the tickets for our new connecting flights right outside the plane but were asked to leave the security area and go to the Hotel counter.\n\nAfter dealing with the Hotel counter and waiting for an hour, and then another hour on the bus — I managed to get about three hours of sleep before heading back to the airport at 4 a.m.   \n  \nI arrived at my final  destination with about 12 hours of delay, but also a few hours late for work.\n\nSince my final destination was in the EU, I initially thought I could claim compensation under EU Regulation 261/2004. However, I learned from Reddit that flights starting outside the EU on non-EU carriers don’t qualify under this rule. Instead, I discovered Turkey’s **SHY Passenger Rights Regulation** offers similar protections.\n\n# Steps I Took\n\n**1. Filing Feedback with Turkish Airlines**\n\nI submitted a claim directly through [their feedback form](https://www.turkishairlines.com/en-int/any-questions/customer-relations/feedback/), explaining my delay and requesting compensation under the SHY regulation. I included the following documents:\n\n* My passport\n* Boarding passes (screenshots of mobile passes worked fine)\n* Bank account information for the reimbursement\n\n**2. Challenging Their Rejection**\n\nTurkish Airlines initially rejected my claim, citing reasons, I believed, weren’t valid. I escalated the case to the **Turkish Directorate General of Civil Aviation** through [this form](https://yh.shgm.gov.tr/). The portal is in Turkish, so I used Google Chrome’s translation feature to navigate it and ChatGPT to write the texts.\n\nA key step mentioned in the original guide was including a phone number for confirmation. Unfortunately, I later realized I had entered mine incorrectly, as the field was too short for my full number. When I tried to email the Directorate, I found out the email address listed on their site didn’t work.\n\nAfter weeks of waiting, I asked a Turkish colleague to call on my behalf, but before we could call them. Roughly six weeks after my flight, the Directorate updated my claim, and Turkish Airlines confirmed they would reimburse me—despite initially denying my request. I checked the directorate portal every other week for an update — they might have seen my login attempts and noticed I must be legit without phone verification.\n\n**3. Receiving Payment**\n\nI received an email with instructions for claiming my payment. Unlike the original guide, I was given the option to request the payment online instead of visiting a ticket office, which made it really convenient.\n\n**4. Final Payment**\n\nFour days later, the money was transferred to my bank account.\n\n# Tips for Others\n\n* **Understand Your Rights:** Turkey’s SHY regulation covers delays, missed connections, and cancellations on Turkish Airlines flights, even if the route isn’t eligible under EU regulations. (I guess because they are trying to become an EU member, they already have some similar policies in place.)\n* **Prepare Your Documents:** Ensure you have copies of your passport, boarding passes, booking confirmations and rebooking confirmations ready.\n* **Be Persistent:** Don’t give up if Turkish Airlines denies your claim. Escalate it to the Directorate and follow up as needed. I’ve even seen others on Reddit succeed without involving the Directorate at all.\n* **Check Your Submission Details:** Double-check phone numbers and other information when submitting your claim. Use the optional fields for further comments if necessary.\n\nDelays are frustrating, but compensation can help make up for the hassle. I hope this post inspires others to pursue what they’re entitled to. It was disheartening to see people give up at the sales office or online, so don’t let the process discourage you.\n\nFeel free to share your experiences or ask for advice below—I’m happy to help!",

    "text": "**AMEX**\n\n*Centurion*. You did it. You reached the top of the mountain. How does it feel? Was it worth it? You’ve spent millions of dollars each year — enough to support hundreds of impoverished families — to qualify for the privilege of a massive buy-in and annual fee. You could have saved a rainforest, but you didn’t. This card is an awful earner for your millions in spend, but it doesn’t matter. The satisfaction you feel when you tap that black card for a $7 coffee makes quartering your point earn worthwhile. In practice, your Centurion rep is not as talented as your other two corporate assistants.\n\n*Platinum*. You spend whole days each year trying to “break even” on a $700 card. You probably earn 1x on almost all spending you put on the card. You lie to yourself, claiming that you use Equinox and Walmart+. You probably tell everyone that this is “the most premium card you can apply for,” when really it’s just a huge profit driver for AMEX. You self-justify during the two annual occasions in which you use an overcrowded Centurion Lounge, and purposely book red eyes to avoid the lines. You don’t even get primary auto rental insurance.\n\n*Schwab Platinum*. Same as above, but you decided to save $200 per year by moving no less than $1.5M into Schwab managed accounts. You tell literally everyone about the 1.1 cpp cashout, even though cashback individuals would almost certainly be better off with other setups. You probably forewent ~70k MR SUB points in order to get the Schwab variant over the vanilla variant.\n\n*Morgan Stanley Platinum*. Same as above, but you use a brokerage that no one has in their top three. At least you get the first authorized user for free, allowing you to wait in line with family members at Centurion lounges while talking to them about your five-year credit card plan. You probably forewent \\~70k MR SUB points in order to get the Morgan Stanley variant over the vanilla variant.\n\n*Gold*. You agonize over the monthly restaurant credits. You’re constantly trying to remember whether you’ve already used Grubhub this month. For some reason, you call AMEX customer support more than Platinum and Centurion customers. You tell literally everybody about your Gold card, but people just respond by asking whether you’re active duty military or native american. You’re probably just a metrosexual.\n\n*Green*. You meant to get a Chase Sapphire Reserve, but you got denied. You’ve never impressed anyone with this card, and you never discuss it. Friends ask, “what happened to your Gold card?” You decided to acquire this card to try Clear, but realized the service usually takes just as much time as going through the precheck line at most airports.\n\n*Blue Business Plus*. You watched 40 credit card Youtubers tell you that it’s alright to put personal spend on a business card. You’re pretty sure that you can, but constantly worry about your next IRS audit. They probably won’t care, right? Right? At least you earn 2x MR points on everything you buy, which is pretty good! Hopefully, other white collar inmates will think you’re cool.\n\n*Blue Cash Preferred*. You probably have a Chase trifecta but agonized over grocery spend. Welcome to AMEX. The Disney bundle is your first coupon to clip — hope you prefer Captain Marvel over literally every other streaming service. You constantly check whether you are close to hitting your $6000 spending cap for the year, and wonder whether it makes sense to get another grocery card. Your 6% streaming category probably nets you around $6 per year. You use the 3% gas category, even though you can definitely do better.\n\n*Blue Cash Everyday*. You probably have 10 credit cards. You signed up for this one despite mid-tier gas and grocery rewards, because the effective annual fee was negative. Enjoy Hulu and Home Chef. Although folks frequently discuss the 3% online retail category, you’re probably better off with a flat 2x card like the Blue Business Plus or Venture X.\n\n*Everyday Preferred*. Not bad for people who use grocery stores thirty times per month, in order to reach the adequate earn rates. What? You only go to the grocery store 8 times per month? No worries! Check out each item individually! If you make it past the fraud alerts and account closures, you’re set! You are also hopelessly single. Sorry, folks with the Chase trifecta — look elsewhere.  \n\n\n**BANK OF AMERICA**\n\n*Customized Cash Reward*s. Your favorite pasttime is inventing protracted scenarios to show why your setup is marginally better than someone else's. But you only get to make such a claim for the singular 3% category you can choose, for which you'd earn 5.25% with Platinum Honors. Except people with a Custom Cash and a Rewards+ are laughing you out the building at 5.55%, so what are we even doing here? Let's also remember that a 3-4x MR/UR card might effectively out-earn both. You either need like 3 of these for this to be worthwhile or else the reward for parking you money at no one's favorite bank is a wannabe Custom Cash and underwhelming 3.5% on grocery cards. Pretty good 3.5% on wholesale clubs, though. But go ahead — tell me how much you love Bank of America, a bank that's been contracting since 2008.\n\n*Unlimited Cash Rewards*. We get it, you earn 2.625% on all spending. It's a pretty good cashback rate. But folks on team travel will tell you that, with a 2x catch-all card, they need a 1.31+ cpp redemption. That's not a tough sell. By the way, I'd say you aren't fun at parties but if you have this card, then you don't go to parties at all. Theres a 90% chance you eventually move your money and switch to a U.S. Bank Altitude Reserve.\n\nNote: Bank of America has three equally underwhelming travel cards. If you have these cards, then (1) your dad added you as an authorized user, (2) you're already collecting from social security, or (3) your trust fund happens to be through Merrill Lynch.\n\n**CAPITAL ONE**\n\n*Quicksilver*. This card is probably named for the Marvel superhero \"Quicksilver\" to commemorate how short this card falls once visible on-screen. Be honest. You hate this card too, but it was your first. You got 14 mailers for the Quicksilver before relenting, because they knew you were too soft too resist. There is no reason to have or use this card, but that doesn't stop Capital One from marketing this as a premium card for people who wear designer clothing; unfortunately, the only premiums here are those that Capital One earns through interest on its subprime creditholders. \n\n*Savor*. By itself, your card earns mid-tier rewards on grocery and dining. And, while you got it for the 10% Uber benefit, you've come to realize that this benefit was painfully temporary, ike all joy in this world. As a coping mechanism, you recommend this card to literally everyone, regardless of circumstance or usefulness. This card, when paired with the Venture X, is pretty good at earning transferable points. It’s too bad that your transfer partners are primarily overseas airlines that your family would refuse to fly on. See Venture X.\n\n*Venture*. You got this card accidentally. You meant to get the Venture X. They won’t let you product change. You’re in limbo.\n\n*Venture X*. 40 credit card Youtubers recommended that you get this card. You tell literally everyone that this card has no flaws. But you’ve always considered putting travel spend on other cards with greater earn rates, giving up your travel insurance. You’ve probably never seen a C1 lounge, nor have you ever used a generic priority pass lounge. You’ve always hated travel portals, but you’ve started telling people they don’t rip you off “that much.” You are totally unfamiliar with most of the transfer partners. You had to google what kind of night show “Accor Live Limitless” was. You’ve never flown Air Canada, nor British Airways, but thought maybe you’d fly with them eventually. For every new loyalty program you join to transfer points, you will receive promotional emails in perpetuity. Perhaps you tell people that it’s super easy and convenient to book qualified United award flights through Turkish Airlines a year in advance, subject to blackout dates. News flash, 26-year old financial guru: it’s not.\n\n**CHASE**\n\n*Freedom Rise*. Your older brother suggested you use Chase because he has a checking account there. Congratulations, you just started and you’ve already committed to getting a Chase Trifecta. Don’t spend your $25 SUB all at once.\n\n*Freedom*. You either forget you owned this card, or you’re a credit card pro. As such, cardholders either purchase $0 or $1500 per quarter — no in between. You value your Costco membership above having a strictly better Flex card introduced by Chase. One day, you will grow tired of fighting Chase to keep this card. Until then, enjoy your quarterly calls to customer service to explain why you do not want to product change. Oh, and cherish the three months a year where Chase doesn’t hang you out to dry for groceries.\n\n*Freedom Flex*. This card sits in the sock drawer for roughly half the year. For the remaining quarters, you manufacture spending and drain your checking account. This might be the closest thing to an in-person grocery card that Chase has. Hope you didn’t want to use this at Costco.\n\n*Freedom Unlimited*. You constantly try to cope with the fact that you earn 1.5x as a catch-all, instead of 2x with AMEX, Chase, or Citi. You have 32 paragraphs written out explaining why Hyatt justifies receiving 25% fewer points per dollar, compared to other issuers. You agonize about the 5/24 rule. AMEX friends describe your setup as “tacky,” or “cute.”\n\n*Sapphire Preferred*. You live in fear of Hyatt being discontinued as a Chase partner. You have no idea how to use the $50 portal credit without overpaying by a similar sum. You have Instacart+ and Pelotan credits but will never use either. You have excellent travel protection but frequently consider putting travel expenses on other cards with better earn rates. You literally cry when someone mentions \"buying groceries in-person.\" You contemplate switching to the AMEX Gold a few times per year.\n\n*Sapphire Reserve*. You live in fear of Hyatt being discontinued as a Chase partner. You struggle to justify the $250 effective annual fee. You tell AMEX folks that, at least, you don’t have statement credits to work through. But you do — there’s Lyft Pink, DoorDash, Instacart+, and Peloton — but you aren’t aware that you need to use them. You’ve also never used a normal priority pass lounge — your main airports may not even have one. You wish you had an AMEX Platinum every time you pass a Centurion Lounge. But those Sapphire lounges have to be coming soon, right?\n\n*J.P. Morgan Reserve*. You could have had the substantively similar Sapphire Reserve, but you wanted to one-up your rich friends with the AMEX Centurion. Everyone mistakes this card for the Platinum, and will ask you how much you love the concierge. You won’t be rich for long.\n\n*Ritz Carlton*. has a a good option for credit card lifers who, oddly, stay at Marriott hotels like 4 times per year. Some credit card YouTuber told you to get this card. Thankfully, it was a good fit; you’re the kind of person who orders off-menu from fast food restaurants. It was discontinued 6-7 years ago, but I’m sure your five year plan to acquire it will work out. At least you gain access to the singular Sapphire lounge — that’ll show those morons with the Bonvoy Brilliant! By the way, your status is pointless within the United States — and if you have this card, you probably think about traveling internationally a lot but never go further than North America. You still don’t understand how the flight credit works.\n\n*Marriott Boundless*. You are desperately trying to figure out how to turn this into a Ritz Carlton card. It's an alright card for what is likely the best hotel chain. That's a bit like being the \"best\" type of heart disease. Decent multiplier for Marriott properties, with an annual fee ordinarily justified by the presence of a 35k point free night certificate. But have you ever tried to use one of these? Hope you like listening to domestic abuse next door in your complimentary one-night stay at a TownePlace Suites.\n\n*IHG \\[Anything\\]*. You must like Kimpton enough to justify countless out-of-date resorts, totally devalued points, and a chain that is in no one’s top three. You’ve never heard of Accor live limitless, but you’ll be switching to them in around three years when you’re tired of IHG. Ranked #2 in the world for hotels with Gold and Green curtains — somehow behind Trump Hotels.\n\n*World of Hyatt*. This car has never seen the outside of your sock drawer, serving only to increase the quality of life during your occassional reward stays. Your loyalty program is overrun by every 25-year old with a Chase trifecta — including you. 90% of Hyatt hotels are identical and depressing. Nicer Hyatts (e.g. Thompson, Andaz) are disproportionately expensive, artificially driving up your perceived redemption rate. You will switch to a cashback setup if Hyatt gets removed from the Chase Trifecta.\n\n*Ink \\[Anything\\]*. You have absolutely no loyalty to anything in life. You churn through credit card issuers like you move through relationships. You outright lie about your revenue or income to the bank. You don’t wonder whether or not personal spend can go on business cards — you’re certain that it may. You get, like, three of these per year for your “resale business.” You tell literally everyone about the Chase 5/24 rule. You are a member of r/churning.\n\n*Amazon*. This card is fine if you plan to maintain a lifelong addiction to unsustainable warehouse conditions and two-day shipping. Every time you check Amazon, you find fewer and fewer brands you’ve heard of: TASALON stools, TOONOW blankets, and TERLULU silverware. But if you’re into outsourced production and corporate overloads, I guess this is fine.\n\n**CITI**\n\n*Custom Cash*. Your credit limit is probably $600, which is fine because you earn 1% on anything above $500 within a category. You log-in almost daily toward the end of the month due to the anxiety of exceeding the cap. You think this card is a good fit for literally everybody. You probably have three of these, just like you probably have three partners you hope don't find out about one another. You also probably have a Chase trifecta, seeking out a grocery or gas card. But you will invariably get sucked into the Citi ecosystem, until horrible customer service experiences or subpar transfer partners drive you away.\n\n*Double Cash*. You’re a boring person and have absolutely no stand-out features as a human being. Everyone else will recommend that you next get a Custom Cash, then a Premier — advice which you will accept. If you choose another ecosystem, this card will become useless or replaceable. Welcome to Citi, sucker.\n\n*Premier*. You fell in love with the reward categories, and have a weird fixation on travel portals. You are either a credit card amateur or a credit card professional, depending on whether you took on these transfer partners unknowingly or intentionally. You also have no real travel insurances or priority pass. You google “Citi Strata update 2024” three times per week.\n\n*Rewards+*. Everyone who has this card was, at one point, a gamer. No idea why. Also for people who want to make a lifelong commitment to Citi bank. It’s like those who get stuck in a bad marriage but decides to renew vows anyway.\n\n*Costco Anywhere*. Do you wish you could convert more of your liquid cash into gift certificates? You’re in luck. Here, you can accrue rewards all year — in convenient gift certificates instead of inconvenient liquid money. You didn’t realize that you could get 2% (or more) back at Costco with an array of alternative cards. You are literally the most frugal person in the world, but that doesn’t mean you’re good with money. You’ll one day build a survival shelter, probably.\n\n**CREDIT ONE**\n\n*\\[Anything\\].* You were probably scammed. You might have the basis for a valid legal claim. Next, I have a bridge to sell you.\n\n***DISCOVER***\n\n*It.* You’re 19 years old and probably attend a big state school. Discover hopes that one high-value year is enough to keep you as a customer for life. It won’t be. After opening an It as your first credit card, you will find its usefulness wanes after the first-year cashback match expires. After that, you spend the rest of your life wondering whether it’s a good time to cancel.\n\n**U.S. BANK**\n\n*Cash+*. If you have this card, you’re an advanced cashback user. It’s a fine card — 5% back on utilities, internet, TV and streaming. It’s unique categories allow us to overlook the fact that your credit limit is probably $2,000 — and that you’ve been noticing diminishing returns from the credit card game for a long time.\n\n*Shopper Cash*. Probably not worthwhile, except for a narrow subset of use cases. You probably shop at Walmart, but would be better off getting Walmart+ and calling it a day. Assuming you maximize your 6% categories, you earn $360/year, or $265 after the annual fee. You’ll stop using this card in about two years.\n\n*Smartly*. Let's pretend for a second that this 4% catch-all card is sustainable once U.S. Bank realizes that people parking funds is not sufficiently revenue generating to justify coughing up this much value. In such a world, these would be strong rewards. But there will be a nerf, and the joke will be on you. And there's a hidden annual fee: the opportunity cost on superior savings or money market rates elsewhere on $100,000 or more. If you walk out of a car dealership and the salesmen high five, you got scammed; well, the U.S. Bank executives haven't stopped clapping since Smartly's release.\n\n*Altitude Go*. It’s a great starter card for those seeking a secured option to build credit. 4% dining is decent cashback. But you’ll inevitably put this card in the sock drawer once you find a 5% or 3x dining alternative. You’re probably trying to find the right time to cancel.\n\n*Altitude Connect*. 4% on gas or EV charging is the lone highlight on this card. It's simply outclassed. When you buy cars, you go to Car and Driver and sort from worst to best within a segment. For some reason, I am certain that these cardholders also bank with U.S. Bank.\n\n*Altitude Reserve*. This unusual card could have made U.S. Bank a powerhouse — but didn’t. You probably got this card before making mobile payment a habit, and you’re not sure whether you’ll stick to it long-term. First, you need to get approved for this card — but probably won’t. Second, you need to settle for no more than 4.5% back on any given category. Third, you can’t pool your U.S. Bank points from other cards for the 1.5 cpp redemptions. Admittedly, it’s sweet to get 1.5 cpp on all travel redemptions, even at brands with low-value loyalty points like Hilton or Marriott. Your new favorite mantra is “do you take Apple Pay?” Your friends and loved ones roll their eyes when you ask that in a crowded bar or sit-down restaurant. They hate when you stop at a gas station, but begin looking for another once you find it does not accept mobile wallet payments. You can’t easily overcome the $60-75 effective annual fee. But you do get to visit underwhelming priority pass lounges up to eight (8) times per year. Maybe that’s enough!\n\n**WELLS FARGO**\n\n*Autograph*. So you applied for a middle-of-the-pack cashback card with the hopes of unlocking forthcoming transfer partners? Keep waiting. You listen intently when they tell you that these delays are to “get things right,” when obviously these delays were sparked by disarray to mitigate an underwhelming release. You wish you had the Chase trifecta. Your credit limit is probably $2,500.\n\n*Active Cash*. You’re naive and impatient. You signed onto the first 2% card you heard about. You probably shop at Costco. You wait desperately for the transfer partners, which are delayed about as often as the Tesla Cybertruck. You live in denial with the belief that these partners will include American or Hyatt — when you’ll be lucky if they rival Citi.\n\n*Bilt Mastercard*. You rent, and will never be able to afford a mortgage. Especially because you’re apparently allergic to SUBs. You’re certainly under the age of 32. This is essentially a Chase Sapphire Preferred with no ecosystem. You manufacture 40% of your monthly spend to occur on Rent Day. You live in fear of the “nerf,” or of Bilt declaring bankruptcy. You probably fly American Airlines and constantly check whether others have added it as a transfer partner. Your credit limit is probably $2,500.\n\n**REDSTONE FCU**\n\n*Signature*. You are from the northeast, yet pilfered this local credit union for its credit card offering. Sorry, credit lifers — you can no longer get this card if you live outside of TN and AL. For those who already have it, I hope you feel good about yourselves. You joined some weird organization you’ve never heard of, just so you could schedule a Skype call with a nice, elderly staff member. You then lied straight to the face of this sweet old southern lady. Yes, you were very interested in Redstone's other financial offerings. Of course, you wanted to open that checking account. And you just happened to have a natural fondness for credit unions and southern charm. For your dishonesty, you are condemned to the most confusing portal of any credit card issuer, finding that your points oddly double then halve themselves. It might be the least convenient cashback card on the market. You recommend this card to literally everyone, mostly to remind them that you have it. You live in constant fear of nerfs.\n\n**BREAD FINANCIAL (FKA COMENITY)**\n\n*AAA Daily Advantage.* The categories are great. The rewards are great. The app is trash, and the customer service is worse. You’re almost better off getting paper notices. Rebranding can evade reputation for some, but the rest of us remember when Comenity ruined everyone’s credit scores for months. If you’re thinking about taking the plunge, you almost certainly have a Chase Trifecta or a young cashback setup. You frequently wonder whether it’s worthwhile to eat the annual fee and switch to the AMEX Blue Cash Preferred.\n\n*AAA Travel Advantage.* For most people, this is a poorer card than the Daily Advantage, but it has good categories and rewards. The customer service and app are woefully underwhelming. If you get this card, I just assume you drive an ICE Hummer or super-duty pickup. You’re almost certainly on team cashback, and have about 6 cards that you don’t use.\n\n*\\[Anything\\].* Enjoy your store card, prick. You were definitely misled by some retail worker. Hopefully, that Bed, Bath & Beyond or Victoria’s Secret card was a good investment for you. People just organically assume that you have credit card debt.\n\n**SYNCHRONY**\n\n*PayPal*. You’re middle-aged, and have no idea what Venmo is. The rewards structure is decent, but you likely impulse applied for this card too quickly to consider whether it was the best choice.\n\n*Venmo*. You're at most 24 years old and, for some reason, are always hanging with the boys. Your favorite alcohol is beer. You get 3% on one category and 2% on another — so it's basically a worse version of a BOA CCR and so many other cards. But if you want this card to be even more useless, you can turn your cashback into Crypto. Just watch those rewards exhaust themselves!\n\n*Sam’s Club*. Pretty decent for Sam’s Club and gas purchases, with a slightly more flexible rewards structure than Costco. But your off-brand Costco card is unlikely to make up for the fact that you brought discount flowers to your first date, or refused to tip the staff at your wedding venue. Like the Costco card, I sure hope you value store credit just as highly as liquid money.\n\n*Verizon*. Do you value “Verizon Dollars,” more than liquid money? This is the only card earning this patented currency on the entire market! Good earning structure, though. I’d warn you about Synchrony’s customer service, but you have Verizon — you’re used to it.\n\n*\\[Anything\\]*. Enjoy your store card, prick. You were definitely misled by some retail worker at Mattress Firm or American Eagle. People just organically assume that you have credit card debt.\n\n**FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF OMAHA**\n\n*Amtrak*. Underrated card with solid point earn and solid 2.5 cpp redemptions for those alone the Northeast Regional line. Did you make the mistake of living elsewhere, in a country which woefully underfunds rail transport? It's not for you. Glad you can redeem for aspirational experiences like a coach seat on a 90 minute train where you're immediately treated like a second-class citizen by staff.\n\n**LUXURY CARDS**\n\n*\\[Anything\\]***.** You are either insufferable or gullible. You enter a liquor store and buy the most expensive bottle — with zero understanding if its the best. You buy cars for over MSRP. You probably speculate in real estate on the side. You post in r/personalfinance about your struggles to make ends meet with a $150,000 income. You have a serious gambling problem.\n\n**GOLDMAN SACHS**\n\n*Apple Card.* You're reading this on your iPhone 16 Pro Max. You kept reminding your friends that the new one \"has titanium, bro.\" You got the credit card for the same reason. You purchased the most premium feeling card, just to upload it into an Apple Wallet and throw it into a sock drawer. You have, at most, two credit cards. You get 2% on almost all Apple Pay, which is almost as good as a 2% catch-all card. You also tell people about the 4% savings account, when anyone could access higher yields elsewhere. Goldman Sachs is backing out of this deal just as fast as the users who made the mistake of procuring one.\n\nI’d love to hate on more card offerings. Anyone have suggestions?\n\nEDIT: Can't believe this became the #1 post on our sub-Reddit. That's awesome. Thank you for the support, everyone!",
